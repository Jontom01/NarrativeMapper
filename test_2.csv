ROUNDING to the NEAREST quarter-hour.\n\nIt was meant to make processing time cards and payroll easier and to reduce clerical mistakes that could potentially actually mess up hours more drastically.\n\nIt was done as a time saver, too, obviously. So if an employer processed their own time cards instead of having an HR employee handle the task, and was super cheap, they could take a little extra time to be sure they always rounded up or down in their favor. Yes, then that is absolutely wage theft. The rounding rule has to be applied fairly. 4:01 would become 4:00. 4:10 would become 4:15. 4:25 would become 4:30.\n\nThat was in the past. Nowadays, even the smallest employer can save even more money and time by having things more automated. And in that case, no rounding is necessary or beneficial. Computers make it unnecessary.\n\nRemember, the practice was not designed to save money on labor hours - they should come out to be the same with rounding over time. So all it reduced was time to process payroll and errors made doing so.\n\nAny employer that decides to save money by spending more time nowadays to go out of their way to always round in their favor is probably not making a lot of money and is spending their time focused on the small things, not trusting their staff and treating them well, and is generally maybe struggling at their business anyway.\n\nAnd stealing. That's stealing. It's a fine line. Which is one reason why when computerized systems came along, it was advantageous to abandon the rounding practice -- it caused issues and questions even when it was done honestly and fairly, which could still hurt trust, cohesiveness, and as a result productivity and insider thefts, etc... better to be completely transparent with employees so there are no questions along those lines any more."", 'Tell them to fuck off and that you will send the badge back once they send a prepaid parcel envelope to your house.', '""Sorry boss, I won\'t be in as I\'ve contracted pink eye ""\n\nStop beating around the bush with your boss.

He was a good guy."", ""\\*Edit 9/6/24:\n\nSince a lot of people seem to misunderstand how this works, I'll clarify. The obligation of an employer is to maintain accurate timekeeping for every employee. How they do this isn't regulated, but the information required is. (hours worked per day, clock in/out times, breaks, paid wages, etc.) This means they don't have to use a time clock, but if they do, they must still report accurate hours for the employee with that system.\n\nIn the OP's case they have a malfunctioning time clock system. That's an employer problem, not an employee one, but the employer is threatening not to pay employees for hours \\*they should know the employee is working.\\* If this came up in litigation or a labor dispute at a state/local level, the employer would be on the hook to show that the employee did not work using the \\*accurate hours they are required by law to keep.\\*\n\nThe first response to that requirement would be the (correct) statement that their time clock system is not functioning properly and therefore they are not keeping accurate records. In several states (California/NY/et al) the lack of accurate employer records alone is sufficient basis to rely solely on employee verbal claims for damages, since it is not the employees job to keep  the accurate records. In other states a simple written record kept by the employee with dates/times is sufficient.\n\nAlso - you people trying to defend the employer need to knock it off. Their job is to maintain accurate records and they are failing to do so. Getting upset because I don't tolerate nonsense from employers doesn't make me upset it just makes you look like a weirdo.  \n\n\nPrevious:\n\nSo this is an interesting scenario where its actually fairly cut and dry how its handled. Employers are responsible for accurately reporting hours, full stop. It doesn't matter if an employee time clock doesn't work, or they forget to report, or what have you. \\*Accurately\\* reporting that time (and taxes etc) is the sole responsibility of the employer.\n\nThey can punish employees for failing to report hours, even fire them, but they cannot simply assume you are not at work when they should reasonably know otherwise. That is fraud, and is a crime. The correct action in scenarios where employee hours are uncertain is to pay tentative or estimated hours as usual for the pay period and verify after the fact. (e.g. if they normally work 40 hours/week, pay them the 40 hours and adjust any difference on the next paycheck)\n\nYou can read more about that sort of thing below, but basically, if an employer knows (or should know) about work being done, they must accurately account for and pay for it.\n\n[https://www.employmentlawletter.com/2023/09/what-employers-should-do-when-employees-fail-to-report-time/](https://www.employmentlawletter.com/2023/09/what-employers-should-do-when-employees-fail-to-report-time/)"", 'I\'ll never forget my boss trying to get ahold of me on my day off and said ""if I can\'t get ahold of you through email, messenger, or text, what other method can I use?"".

A million people hungry, needing the fruit- and kerosene sprayed over the golden mountains. And the smell of rot fills the country. Burn coffee for fuel in the ships. Burn corn to keep warm, it makes a hot fire. Dump potatoes in the rivers and place guards along the banks to keep the hungry people from fishing them out. Slaughter the pigs and bury them, and let the putrescence drip down into the earth.\n\n>There is a crime here that goes beyond denunciation. There is a sorrow here that weeping cannot symbolize. There is a failure here that topples all our success. The fertile earth, the straight tree rows, the sturdy trunks, and the ripe fruit. And children dying of pellagra must die because a profit cannot be taken from an orange. And coroners must fill in the certificate- died of malnutrition- because the food must rot, must be forced to rot. The people come with nets to fish for potatoes in the river, and the guards hold them back; they come in rattling cars to get the dumped oranges, but the kerosene is sprayed. And they stand still and watch the potatoes float by, listen to the screaming pigs being killed in a ditch and covered with quick-lime, watch the mountains of oranges slop down to a putrefying ooze; and in the eyes of the people there is the failure; and in the eyes of the hungry there is a growing wrath.
