They were planning on using it for assessing just the hourly employees back then. It was a pretty clunky demonstration of videos and how their platform was assessing the score.¬†


Supposedly, it is meant to eliminate racial bias (and other biases) the hiring manager and recruiters might have as all they would see is the score. The videos were viewable only by the higher level recruiting users, but of course not all companies would stick to this approach and probably just use the platform to cut corners or save time in the recruiting process to do the interview for them.

""Fast food may be cheap, but the industry can‚Äôt afford to be with its workers anymore.

A TikToker named Corynne (user handle u/c0rynne) says this is the reason she left her job as a video editor and cameraman at NBC.

In a recent video she posted, the on-screen captions say that she started working at a Domino‚Äôs location despite having a bachelor‚Äôs degree because it pays $4 more per hour than NBC. Plus, she receives tips and her ""superior aren't bullies.""

‚ÄúThe way \[I\] earned more in four hours on a slow day delivering pizza than \[I\] did an 8 hour shift working for NBC,‚Äù¬†[reads the caption below her viral video](https://www.tiktok.com/@c0rynne/video/7358233410298514734).

2. When I asked for a raise it was granted on the spot after *three (3!) months*, $1.50/HR raise. My gf asked for her first raise ever that same week only a couple of days after me & was told there's no room in the budget.

So we both quit because riteaid employs sexist managers.

I was the first employee at a start up company, almost 2 years later I was the ""operations manager"", owner of the company went on a vacation out of the country for a week and a half, his son who worked there also hurt himself so he was off work, and we just hired a new lady to work in our office. I was doing my work, his son's work, and training the new lady remotely over the phone since I was in the field. I deduced from the other 4 companies I talked to that I was being underpaid by $2/hr, not to mention I was a ""manager"", so I was doing more work than the people at the other companies as well. Told my boss I wanted a $4 raise. $2 to match the other companies, and another $2 for the time I've been there plus the responsibilities I've taken on.

He said no.

His two reasons were A, the people I've talked to don't actually pay their employees that much/earn that much, and B, I didn't know how to do the new hire's job EVEN THOUGH I TRAINED HER REMOTELY WHILE DOING THE WORK OF TWO PEOPLE

He agreed to the $2 if I took on more responsibility. I thought about it because I wasn't sure if I was being irrational. But eventually that $2 became $1, and a month after that conversation I quit

Since a lot of people seem to misunderstand how this works, I'll clarify. The obligation of an employer is to maintain accurate timekeeping for every employee. How they do this isn't regulated, but the information required is. (hours worked per day, clock in/out times, breaks, paid wages, etc.) This means they don't have to use a time clock, but if they do, they must still report accurate hours for the employee with that system.

In the OP's case they have a malfunctioning time clock system. That's an employer problem, not an employee one, but the employer is threatening not to pay employees for hours \*they should know the employee is working.\* If this came up in litigation or a labor dispute at a state/local level, the employer would be on the hook to show that the employee did not work using the \*accurate hours they are required by law to keep.\*

The first response to that requirement would be the (correct) statement that their time clock system is not functioning properly and therefore they are not keeping accurate records. In several states (California/NY/et al) the lack of accurate employer records alone is sufficient basis to rely solely on employee verbal claims for damages, since it is not the employees job to keep  the accurate records. In other states a simple written record kept by the employee with dates/times is sufficient.

Also - you people trying to defend the employer need to knock it off. Their job is to maintain accurate records and they are failing to do so. Getting upset because I don't tolerate nonsense from employers doesn't make me upset it just makes you look like a weirdo.  


Previous:

So this is an interesting scenario where its actually fairly cut and dry how its handled. Employers are responsible for accurately reporting hours, full stop. It doesn't matter if an employee time clock doesn't work, or they forget to report, or what have you. \*Accurately\* reporting that time (and taxes etc) is the sole responsibility of the employer.

They can punish employees for failing to report hours, even fire them, but they cannot simply assume you are not at work when they should reasonably know otherwise. That is fraud, and is a crime. The correct action in scenarios where employee hours are uncertain is to pay tentative or estimated hours as usual for the pay period and verify after the fact. (e.g. if they normally work 40 hours/week, pay them the 40 hours and adjust any difference on the next paycheck)

You can read more about that sort of thing below, but basically, if an employer knows (or should know) about work being done, they must accurately account for and pay for it.

Apparently he didn't check the blockout book. I still wish I could have seen the long distance charge for that call.

They insisted on Saturday and i told them there was a good chance that our flights may get cancelled AGAIN and that the SM assured me I wouldn't be scheduled until I got back. Managers got pissed but had to figure things out themselves.

Long story short, my travel agent got me back home that night but i was jet lagged for several days due to all the screw ups and my store manager wasn't impressed with the other managers that scheduled me and gave me a hard time during my vacation.

As a teenager, Mike had worked at a fast food restaurant. There was an external seating area at this restaurant they called ""the enclosure."" It was well known for getting very, very messy.

One day Mike was told by his manager to clean up the enclosure. He was given one hour to do this.

He did his best. He gathered up all of the loose garbage, he wiped up all of the spills, he put everything in order that he could. However, at the end of that hour, the enclosure was not up to his manager's standards, and so he received an informal reprimand.

The next day, the enclosure was just as messy as ever, and so his manager decided to teach him a lesson. His manager said pointedly that he was going to clean up the enclosure perfectly, and do so in only 15 minutes, while Mike watched.

Sure enough, due to experience, planning, skill, and intelligence, his manager had this area perfect in less than 15 minutes. End of story.

And so, according to Mike, this taught him there was *always* enough time to get the work done, no matter what it was. I should not be making excuses about insufficient time.

What I wanted to say at this point: Okay, Mike, go ahead and write, test, and debug this code for me *yourself* in the two days you have allotted.

What I actually said: Mike, it sounds like your manager at that fast food restaurant was much more accomplished at his job than any inexperienced teenager could possibly be.

This happened to me once. I made $13/hr+tips running a food truck at a popular bar. Took home about $1300/week +cash between hourly/ot/ and electronic tips. I ran the food to people's tables so a lot of people gave me 20%. It was just me in the truck. So the boss fires me, says she'll give me the deposit in 2 weeks. I tell her no, you'll do it in 24 hours because that's texas law. She said thats not true and got condescending about me being a cook vs her being a business owner (2 pyramid schemes and a failing food truck all wasting her husbands money) and after exchanged insults  I sent her a screenshot of the TX law. The next day, I get a check for like, $300. I ask her where the fuck the rest of it is and she sends me a screenshot of TX ""tip credit law"" and  says something like ""this is a lesson to you about your attitude and thinking youre so smart, you're a cook not a business owner for a reason"" she told me tip credit meant she could pay me 5 an hour and only give me enough of the tips to make 7.25 and the business keeps the rest of the tips.  She admitted to 2 crimes through text.I demanded my owed money and the data from the register, for the entire time i worked there, and threw many more insults. Said if she didn't, I would call the state labor commission and the cops. Because wage theft is civil and criminal in texas.  After a condescending and directly insulting lesson from me on how tip credits work and changing pay rates were illegal. She said she would call her lawyer and have him call me to explain that she was right.

Under an hour later I get a text that says ""please check your account and let me know if the money has made it, if not I will cancel the deposit and get you a check by the end of the day"" and then sent me all the paystub math and all the register data.

1. It's not a start up. She claimed it was. despite it being an instagram page and not a legitimate company, the page itself carried name/brand recognition locally. The page was kind of like a local events/news page that has a strong youth demographic, which I thought would look good on my portfolio when it comes to interviews and being asked for experience (experience is cruical here). She would call herself a startup since she claimed to generate revenue via paid sponsorships at events and on her page, claimed to own a marketing company (never gave me details on, dont even know if its true), she gave me bullshit about hiring more interns to create more content (which she never did, and then walked back on when we asked about it multiple times), gave me bullshit on hiring people to create a website (which still hasn't been created). Partned with a small media company (which she later on ended association with without telling me, which led me to film all the events) 
Until now, the company consists of one person. So yeah, I was scammed. 

2. No need to take legal action, theyre already fucked and I actually got what I wanted out of this ""internship"" despite the fact that I pretty much taught myself everything about creating social media content and taking and editing videos on my own, i just consider this personal portfolio work i probably woudve done on my own, the fact that it was for the page just lent it credibility as ""experience"". So all that's added to my portfolio, she can't take away from me. Every other unpaid intern, employee or buisness partner she had lasted around a month before quitting, her retention rate is zero, she has lost 3 people on her team so far. Her page is gonna go to shit since me and the other intern quit, since we're the only people who made content for the page were just going to sit back and watch her page go nowhere, she has no chance of going anywhere with the way she treats her employees, especially unpaid interns who are treated like garbage like i was, only i had the patience to put up with it for so long, the silver lining is that she said she no longer plans on recruiting unpaid interns because they all end up leaving (no shit) and she doesnt have the time to invest in ""training"" them, and if she does hire someone they'll either quit since she's so toxic and doesn't know how to manage 2 people let alone a group or report her for breach of contract/not paying a salary which she'll probably end up doing just like she did with my ""internship certificate"" from the internet which i woudve used to wipe my ass with. As time goes by it'll be made clear that she's a clown with no clue how to run a buisness let alone a page on Instagram.

The store was open 13 hours a day (8-9), 14 during holidays, 7 days a week.  The rule was you had to have two people closing (state required minimum 4 hour shift.)  Trucks were expected to be worked on 2-3 days a week starting at 6 am instead of 8 AM.

Let's do some math.  13x7=91 +1/2 hour per day for open or closing time (counting drawers, etc.) 3.5 hours + second person closing 4x7 = 28 plus the extra 2 hours x 2 days x3 employees to work truck = 12 hours.  Goodness, we are already up to 134.5 hours.  I guess the extra 14.5 hours will have to come out of a salaried employee.  Oh, that's me.  Now, who do I want to work alone for the 9 hours a day we don't have double coverage?  No one?  Ok, I guess that means I'm also working the 9 x7 = 63 hours it takes to have double coverage.  Add in the 14.5, and we have 77.5 hours a week I need to work to make sure there aren't hours at a time with only one employee in the store.

All for the lovely salary of around $35K per year.  And all before the first employee calls off or quits and no one is there to cover them.

Managers at Dollar General either work alone for about 16 hours a week, go over budget, or work every damn day.

And even doing this, they are being paid salary to work, not to manage.  Just try to get office time while managing a Dollar General, I dare you.

If you wonder why a Dollar General Store looks the way it does, visit their break room and take a look at the schedule posted there (it's not like they'd be able to stop you even if they cared.)  You'll figure it out pretty quickly.","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.999152660369873}"

And since your boss will never have enough money and it will never come fast enough, nothing you do will ever be enough for them.  Come in on a weekend to catch up?  Your job will start expecting that all the time and will grow ""concerned about your motivation"" if you dont do it.  Answer an email after hours?

With the cost of living in WA, the pay that new workers get is barely enough to rent a damned room!

I commuted about 1.5-2 hours to work and then again, back to home when I was there, as I had to live with my parent.

I was fortunate that a coworker had a room available about 9 months into my working there, and I moved in with them. But it was tough trying to pay rent and utilities, not to mention food and such, with the ridiculously low pay we were getting.

The progression steps that one goes through to max out at the top is 6.5 years. Due to my job code, I started out making $19 an hour, with $1 differential for being on 2nd shift. And you take a ""step"" every 6 months, with an increase of 50 cents.

It takes too long to make a liveable wage there, and it's absolutely ridiculous!

They build airplanes! You'd think they would want to train and retain people who are skilled workers, but with the laughably low wages, I knew so many people who left because they weren't making enough to afford to live and support themselves, let alone their family.

Not to mention that for every worker on the floor, there is likely about 3 times the ""management"" above them, breathing down their necks about why things are taking too long.

There are so many issues with getting parts from vendors, they rely too much on outside vendors when they used to do the bulk of it in-house, and knew the quality of the materials and parts they had because their own workers were producing and manufacturing them.

I ended up moving to another state for other reasons, but even so, my significant other works for them down here and makes $15 more an hour, non-union here, than they did in WA after working there 4 years.

It's absolutely ridiculous.

The union lost their bite years ago and kept making concessions to Boeing to keep in the PNW area, but lost workers' confidence and trust in their ability to fight for the workers.

The union is as much to blame as Boeing for this strike, especially after their screw up with the last contract.","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9992616772651672}"

When we allow our economy to grow so top heavy wherein the leveraged value far outweighs the true costs and reasonable investments, the house ceases to be able to cover the cost of the bets and we find ourselves in yet another ballooning investment economy that will need bailing out in the next five years by the real economy.","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9940890073776245}"

After 2008 real estate crisis orchestrated between banks and congress (I worked as a loan officer for a while, after I quit working as an in-house paralegal inspector for illegal tax shelters, and became disillusioned with how man cheating fuckers exist wherever money exists), the left began organizing as Occupy Wallstreet, which our media made fun of, and actual Wall Street AHs pouring champagne on the heads of OWS protestors.  They were working pretty hard to make changes in the free flow of money that created the ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù that then bailed out:  Wall Street, bankers, credit ratings agencies, mortgage companies, hedge funds‚Ä¶. But us regular people still lost everything through foreclosures from predatory NINA loans (who the fuck approved No Income No Asset loans?? Those were Made To Fail).  Then Quantitative Easing, which further socialized losses from Capital, and placed burden on middle class.  

Now we‚Äôre mostly deregulated, OSHA rules continually broken, workers fought for raises, finally get them and runaway inflation from Capital means grocery prices have skyrocketed, and we now hearGOP leadership saying out loud how Working Class needs to be squashed, work till you die, taxed more than billionaires, and frankly, I‚Äôd like to know:

We need them to pay 80% tax after their first 10m.  

We need them to know their place in decent society - it doesn‚Äôt mean CEO class  get to continue taking 90% profits, we need profit sharing back to All employees.  

We need caps on CEO pay, bonuses, and wage theft must be addressed with actual prison time, no tiny fine that is meaningless.

They were simply convinced that it was their role in life. There was an almost Huxleyan control over how they perceived themselves and their social class.

The great success of the elite is not to disguise their wealth or sell mythology to the public (although they do both of these effectively as well). It is to convince people to be acquiescent with the status quo, and to effectively gatekeep the upper echelons of the class and socio-economic structure.

Huxley described this as ""a method of control by which a people can be made to enjoy a state of affairs by which any decent standard they ought not to enjoy...the enjoyment of servitude"". In *Brave New World*, it is depicted that the population not merely accepts, but expects to be part of the social class to which they've been assigned. They are even somewhat hostile to the idea of climbing the ranks, while also looking down on those below them to a certain extent. 

I have found this to be a consistently accurate representation of how society actually operates, and it was especially prevalent in the attitudes of adults when I was growing up.

Why couldn‚Äôt he sell to the workers and aid in the creation of a co-operative?

‚Äúmore than 70 of SecureIT‚Äôs 80 employees ‚Äúon paper, were millionaires,‚Äù .. and then: Between the time of the acquisition [1998] and February 2000, VeriSign‚Äôs stock increased by more than 2,300%, closing at a high of $253 per share, helped by two stock splits and a temporary bubble for tech stocks.

So he sold, gave bonuses in the form of company stock, the stock crashed, and the workers were again left with no actual capital. The stock value returned later - but only if the workers held onto their stocks and weren‚Äôt forced to sell in the 20+ years in between the acquisition and the current, slightly lower value. 

The workers weren‚Äôt ever actually made millionaires. Only ‚Äòon paper‚Äô and their ability to become millionaires is questionable.

Carloads of oranges dumped on the ground. The people came for miles to take the fruit, but this could not be. How would they buy oranges at twenty cents a dozen if they could drive out and pick them up? And men with hoses squirt kerosene on the oranges, and they are angry at the crime, angry at the people who have come to take the fruit. A million people hungry, needing the fruit- and kerosene sprayed over the golden mountains. And the smell of rot fills the country. Burn coffee for fuel in the ships. Burn corn to keep warm, it makes a hot fire. Dump potatoes in the rivers and place guards along the banks to keep the hungry people from fishing them out. Slaughter the pigs and bury them, and let the putrescence drip down into the earth.

>There is a crime here that goes beyond denunciation. There is a sorrow here that weeping cannot symbolize. There is a failure here that topples all our success. The fertile earth, the straight tree rows, the sturdy trunks, and the ripe fruit. And children dying of pellagra must die because a profit cannot be taken from an orange. And coroners must fill in the certificate- died of malnutrition- because the food must rot, must be forced to rot. The people come with nets to fish for potatoes in the river, and the guards hold them back; they come in rattling cars to get the dumped oranges, but the kerosene is sprayed. And they stand still and watch the potatoes float by, listen to the screaming pigs being killed in a ditch and covered with quick-lime, watch the mountains of oranges slop down to a putrefying ooze; and in the eyes of the people there is the failure; and in the eyes of the hungry there is a growing wrath. In the souls of the people the grapes of wrath are filling and growing heavy, growing heavy for the vintage.‚Äù
