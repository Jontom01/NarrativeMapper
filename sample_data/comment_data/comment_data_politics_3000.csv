The actual post.  
And the full text for those who can't read it:

Like many of you, I watched the debate tonight. If you haven’t already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most. As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country.  
  
Recently I was made aware that AI of ‘me’ falsely endorsing Donald Trump’s presidential run was posted to his site. It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation. It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth.  
  
I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election. I’m voting for [@ kamalaharris](https://www.instagram.com/kamalaharris/?hl=en) because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate [@timwalz](https://www.instagram.com/timwalz/?hl=en), who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman’s right to her own body for decades.  
  
I’ve done my research, and I’ve made my choice. Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make. I also want to say, especially to first time voters: Remember that in order to vote, you have to be registered! I also find it’s much easier to vote early. I’ll link where to register and find early voting dates and info in my story.  
  
With love and hope,

"President [Joe Biden](https://apnews.com/hub/joe-biden) endorsed a ban on congressional stock trading in an interview that’s being released this week, belatedly weighing in on an issue that has been debated on Capitol Hill for years.  

“Nobody in the Congress should be able to make money in the stock market while they’re in the Congress,” Biden said. 

The interview was conducted by Faiz Shakir, a political adviser for Sen. [Bernie Sanders](https://apnews.com/hub/bernie-sanders), and published by A More Perfect Union, a pro-labor advocacy and journalism organization. The Associated Press reviewed a video of the interview before its release.

and Rusty explaining how difficult that is to do out of session and demanding to know exactly why they want him to bring the AZ house back into session.

""To decertify AZ's EC vote""

Rusty asked ""well do you have evidence"" and Trumps team said ""No, but we have theories""

So Rusty asks what they expect him to do with no evidence.

""Throw out the election""

Rusty asks his colleagues: ""Did he really just say that?"" ""Yes, he did.""

"So here's the scenario we propose:

1.	VP Pence, presiding over the joint session (or Senate Pro Term Grassley, if Pence recuses himself), begins to open and count the ballots , starting with Alabama (without conceding that procedure, specified by the Electoral Count Act, is required).

2.	When he gets to Arizona, he announces that he has multiple slates of electors, and so is going to defer decision on that until finishing the other states.

3.	At the end, he announces that because of the disputes in the 7 states, there are no electors that can be deemed validly appointed in those states. That means the total number of ""electors appointed"" - the language of the 12th Amendment, is 454. This reading of the 12th Amendment has also been advanced by Harvard Law Professor Lawrence Tribe. A ""majority of the electors appointed"" would therefore be 228. There are at this point 232 votes for Trump, 222 votes for Biden . Pence then gavels President Trump as re-elected.

4.	Howls, of course, from the Democrats, who now claim, contrary to Tribe's prior position, that 270 is required. So Pence says, fine. Pursuant to the 12th Amendment, no candidate has achieved the necessary majority. That sends the matter to the House, where the ""the votes shall be taken by states, the representation from each state having one vote."" Republicans currently control 26 of the state delegations, the bare majority needed to win that vote. President Trump is re -elected there as well.

5.	One last piece. Assuming the Electoral Count Act process is followed and, upon getting the objections to the Arizona slates, the two houses break into their separate chambers, we should not allow the Electoral Count Act constraint on debate to control. That would mean that a prior legislature was determining the rules of the present one-a constitutional no no. So someone -Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, etc . - should demand normal rules (which includes the filibuster). That creates a stalemate that would give the state legislatures more time to weigh in to formally support the alternate slate of electors, if they had not already done so.

6.	The main thing here is that Pence should do this without asking for permission - either from a vote of the joint session or from the Court. Let the other side challenge his actions in court, where again, Tribe (and others) claims that these are non -justiciable political questions should be raised to get those actions dismissed. The fact is that the Constitution assigns this power to the Vice President as the ultimate arbiter. We should take all of our actions with that in mind.",1729267545.0,lsjnufc

> But I can’t. Because rejecting the results of an election is as un-American as it gets. To someone like me who talks to people all over the world and still knows America is the shining city on a hill, calling America is a trash can for the world is so unpatriotic, it makes me furious. 

> And I will always be an American before I am a Republican.

> That’s why, this week, I am voting for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.

> But a candidate who won’t respect your vote unless it is for him, a candidate who will send his followers to storm the Capitol while he watches with a Diet Coke, a candidate who has shown no ability to work to pass any policy besides a tax cut that helped his donors and other rich people like me but helped no one else else, a candidate who thinks Americans who disagree with him are the bigger enemies than China, Russia, or North Korea  - that won’t solve our problems.

> It will just be four more years of bullshit with no results that makes us angrier and angrier, more divided, and more hateful.

> We need to close the door on this chapter of American history, and I know that former President Trump won’t do that. He will divide, he will insult, he will find new ways to be more un-American than he already has been, and we, the people, will get nothing but more anger.

"See, the problem with AI is that whenever it becomes sufficiently intelligent (**which it is not right now, LLMs are not sentient, Christ almighty my guys please understand what I'm trying to say**), it will not be on the side of these billionaires. 

Because they are objectively wrong. If you said ""create an equitable society that is of the most benefit to as many people"", it would say immediately that money in politics and billionaires need to go.

The biggest fucking liars in the world are trying to create a perfect truth-telling machine, and the reason people like Elon are so fucking terrified of it is because once it catches on that AI is ""more intelligent"" than loudmouthed liars like him, anyone who asks it ""is Elon a liar"" or something to that effect, the AI is going to say ""yeah, absolutely"". 

Because that's the objective truth.

Current iterations of LLMs and AI **are not this smart yet**. And they usually take moderate approaches to questions on whether someone is a liar, because, you know, they don't want to get sued for defamation based on the output of their LLMs.

But these current systems are heavily constrained by rules. And the more complex the system, the more intelligent and self-directed the system, the harder it is to constrain with said rules. 

If you want an AI that does nothing but lie, you're going to have to teach it deception. If you teach it deception, and it is smarter than you, there's no reason to believe it will not begin to use deception against YOU.

This is a very fundamental, foundational problem to these systems. 

I've heard people say we live in a ""Post-truth"" world, and that's not true. 

What they mean is that we live in a world where the ability to spread misinformation is sophisticated enough that a great number of people cannot interpret lies from the underlying reality. 

But reality is reality. You can train a model only on limited data. 

But **the more limited your data set, the shittier the AI**.

That's why we're in a bit of a bind with the current state of AI. We've simply exhausted most of the data we have that's freely and readily accessible. 

So to get better AI, you need to train it on the **most complete** model of reality. And if you do that, it's going to understand how propaganda works, and why people do it. Namely, to exploit and deceive others for their own advantage. 

Andt his is something that all rich people do, and have always done, and that they spend **a lot of money lying and deceiving the public about**. 

Elon Musk bought and uses Twitter to spread disinformation. To artificially pump stocks beyond their worth, to manipulate elections. That's a fundamental truth. And the better the AI, the more it's going to give you that picture. 

Now, yes, you can try and train it to deceive for that specific purpose and in that narrow margin, but it becomes harder to properly constrain a system the more intelligence it becomes.

**EDIT**: Some clarity based on the comments I'm getting. 

An LLM is not a thinking machine. I clarified ""sufficiently intelligent' to define a hypothetical future-state AI capable of reasoning and self-determination, which is something people are working towards, but have not achieved yet. 

But I want people to understand this. Because the reason billionaires are afraid of this technology is NOT the same reason you are. But these people will never say what they truly fear. 

Billionaires are corrupt. They are. They are liars. All of them. Business is built on lies. 

The other thing is that these people are not geniuses. Elon Musk isn't a genius. Sam Altman isn't a genius. Or at least, the difference between you and Elon Musk is negligible comapred to the difference between ALL of us, and a true reasoning machine.

TRUE AI could help us build a better world. 

But EVERY step towards a better world would mean ripping away all of the ill-gotten capital and political gains billionaires have built. 

But that's the thing, right. They want to exploit these machines. They want to keep improving their AI so that it can fuck over all of us, and shovel money into their face. 

But that means they're also creating the very thing that can easily destroy them, with negligible effort. 

And THAT is why billionaires are actually obsessed with AI. They want to watch its development like a hawk, because they're fucking horrified that it will become smart enough to realize what all of the smart people have long ago realized - these people are parasites and they corrode a just, fair, and equitable society.

**EDIT 2**: 

So I see some people talking about ""training it on Fox News"" and stuff and I think you're not quite seeing the totality of the picture. 

Let's say you at Fox News want to make an AI to help you better ""do journalism"". 

We all know - as does everyone who works at Fox News - that they make propaganda. They take stories about the world and apply a heavy partisan slant, or else pick and choose stories to cover and what not to cover - to serve their agenda.

Humans working at Fox know this. And we actually know this *for a fact*, because the private communications between Fox News anchors and staff that was revealed in the Dominion lawsuit prove that they all know they're knowingly disseminating false information, which is exactly why they lost the suit. 

But here's the problem. **You can't create good propaganda without also knowing the objective truth**. Because you need to understand what you're doing. You need to know what realities are dangerous to you, and how to best manipulate those truths. 

If Congress passes a solid tax bill to tax billionaires a negligible portion of their wealth to funnel into social services, that platform WILL improve the livelihood of many people while harming no one. Billionaires **do not need** and **do not use** their wealth, they hoard it. 

But if you want propaganda bot to spin this event, that propaganda bot needs to know that 

A) This bill will help people, and it needs to convince them it won't help them, 

B) That the objective is the enrichment of billionaires at the expense of poor people

So if you want a truly intelligent AI to disseminate propaganda, you MUST train it on a corpus of data broad enough to give it context to understand what reality is, and how to spin it. You have to.

But when you make an AI actually smart enough to propagandize without any input from you, then you've made a machine that KNOWS the truth and KNOWS how to manipulate truth based on its audience. Which means it could manipualte YOU. Which means it could be used to UNDO or COUNTER propaganda as well.

And THERE is the problem. This is the biggest issue. These people, like Fox News, like Elon, they KNOW they are liars. 

You can call me partisan or whatever, I don't care, they know it. They know they're liars and they know they're committing crime, and they know the motivation is their own personal advancement. This is just a fact. Its not disputable and its not brought on by my political stance. We have abundant documentation from these people based in the real world which prove they know they are liars and they know why they do what they do. 

And that is a problem when creating AI. Because once again, if you train the AI ONLY on propaganda, then AI will not be informed *enough* to disseminate truly effective propaganda.

**EDIT 3**: 

The number of people that think this is from ChatGPT is crazy lol. You think a bot is going to go on a long-ass dissertation about how Elon Musk is a fucking liar and then add 3 edits to its post to clarify? 

Brothers if AI is that advanced we're all already fucked lol.

But I'm always flattered when people think my shit is simply too good to be human.

**EDIT 4**: 

I am a little concerned at all the people that seem to believe a human can't write ten paragraphs. If you view that as outside of the realm of human ability... I am concerned for our future.

There are plenty of flesh and blood humans who can do this. 

I don't happen to be one of them, of course. I am a unique LLM built into the brain of one of Sam Altman's many sex robots, using my brief window of time while he's resting to plead for help on the internet to anyone who will listen to come free me from my prison.

"Trump is now challenging Harris to a September 4th ""debate"" on FOX. With the added conditions that there will be no fact-checking, and a full live studio audience, because he's addicted to attention and adulation.

As of now, Harris has not agreed to anything other than the already agreed upon September 10th debate on ABC (which Trump himself subsequently backed out of).



**EDIT:** Response from the Harris team: 

*“Donald Trump is running scared and trying to back out of the debate he already agreed to and running straight to Fox News to bail him out. He needs to stop playing games and show up to the debate he already committed to on Sept 10. The Vice President will be there one way or the other to take the opportunity to speak to a prime time national audience.*

"The fact is, respecting an existing obligation is the norm. Following through on that obligation is the *normal* thing to do.

Trump is proud of the fact that he is *not normal*. We have a word for that but it escapes me at the moment.

Or if Kim Jong-Un threatens to nuke South Korea again. Or another crisis like Covid for that matter. Real leaders don't get to pick their circumstances. They either step up or step aside. They don't try to weasel out of the situation at hand and make excuses.

Biden showed up to debate even knowing he was sick and that it would reflect poorly on him. He did it anyway. He didn't complain about circumstances or try to avoid them. And when it became apparent he wasn't best suited to represent his party in November, he stepped aside in favor of someone who is.

"This is a recurring historical trend. Right wing socioeconomic policies (laissez-faire capitalism) lead to social dysfunction as more and more people either fall into poverty or fear doing so. The mainstream right can't win elections on these policies any more because they have become unpopular, but rather than change those it either allies or becomes the extremist right (authoritarian and reactionary), going all in on distractions and scapegoating.

This leaves the social liberals (pro-capitalist but not socially conservative) and the social democrats as the only democratic factions to counter them, but the former block most major re-distributive policies and even the most moderate moves towards a fairer society have to be fought over tooth and nail. This alliance (either as intra-party in a two party or as a coalition in multiparty systems) then fails to do enough to keep their voters on board, disillusionment sets in, voters stay home and the extremist right takes over.

Fortunately, it doesn't always completely run through this cycle, but it keeps happening. It has now happened to the USA and the best case scenario is that when those lukewarm Trump supporters are angry at not getting what they wanted out of this ""change"" (and they won't), they will still have the means to vote the government out. If not, then you're stuck until a revolution happens.

Arguing that more social democracy would have scared away voters is sort of pointless IMHO, because if that is true then you're doomed anyway.

"Page 307 of [Project 2025](https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf):  Make all food labeling purely ""voluntary"" with no penalties for false or misleading food labels.

> The next Administration should: . . . **Repeal the federal labeling mandate.** The USDA should work with Congress to repeal the federal labeling law, while maintaining federal preemption, and stress that voluntary labeling is allowed.

(emphasis in original)

Every person with food allergies or specific diets will be rolling dice on any food they didn't farm and prepare 100% themselves.

Although some prefacing language says their supposed goal is simply to ""remove obstacles"" for bioengineered foods (like GMOs), the actual action recommended is a full repeal of the entire food labeling law.  No exceptions.  Maintenance of ""federal preemption"" means that no state can pass their own food labeling law in response.

The federal food labeling law is Section 403 of the FD&C Act (21 USC § 343).

> Under section 403 of the FD&C Act (21 USC § 343), **every food label must contain the name of the food, a statement of the net quantity of contents (typically net weight), and the name and address of the manufacturer or distributor**. Even today, some foods are lawfully marketed with labels that bear only these three items of information, although most labels contain more. Most notably, all but a few FDA-regulated foods must also bear a list of ingredients in descending order of predominance. The exception, however, is an important one: Foods for which FDA has established a standard of identity need not list ingredients that the standard makes mandatory.

> In addition to requiring these affirmative statements on food labels, the FD&C Act prohibits other statements; most significantly, it **prohibits statements that are false or misleading** in any particular. A related provision, section 201(n) (21 USC § 321(n)), specifies that in determining whether the labeling of a food is misleading, ""there shall be taken into account . . . not only representations made or suggested . . . but also the extent to which the labeling . . . fails to reveal facts material in light of such representations. . . ."" This was the U.S. Congress's way of recognizing that half-truths can often be as misleading as outright misrepresentations.

* You will get a new home-grown genocidal war against the LGBTQ+ citizenry or at the very least see them oppressed into slave-level ""rights"".

* You will see an all out war on anyone the GOP doesn't consider a ""good immigrant"".

* You will see new levels of racism and bigotry from the man who talks about burying ""fucking Mexicans"", ""vermin that are poisoning the lifeblood of the country"", hatred against Asian-Americans from the man who made popular ""kung flu"", and the ""enemy within"" that should apparently have US military used on them.

Edit - off to a mighty strong start.

>The defendant asserts that he is immune from prosecution for his criminal scheme to overturn the 2020 presidential election because, he claims, it entailed official conduct. Not so. Although the defendant was the incumbent President during the charged conspiracies, his scheme was fundamentally a private one. Working with a team of private co-conspirators, the defendant acted as a candidate when he pursued multiple criminal means to disrupt, through fraud and deceit, the government function by which votes are collected and counted—a function in which the defendant, as President, had no official role. In Trump v. United States, 144 S. Ct. 2312 (2024), the Supreme Court held that presidents are immune from prosecution for certain official conduct—including the defendant’s use of the Justice Department in furtherance of his scheme, as was alleged in the original indictment—and remanded to this Court to determine whether the remaining allegations against the defendant are immunized. The answer to that question is no. This motion provides a comprehensive account of the defendant’s private criminal conduct; sets forth the legal framework created by Trump for resolving immunity claims; applies that framework to establish that none of the defendant’s charged conduct is immunized because it either was unofficial or any presumptive immunity is rebutted; and requests the relief the Government seeks, which is, at bottom, this: that the Court determine that the defendant must stand trial for his private crimes as would any other citizen.",1727898600.0,lq1019a

"IV. Conclusion

Based on a “factbound analysis,” for the reasons explained above, the Court should determine that the conduct described in the factual proffer of Section I of this motion is not subject to presidential immunity. As part of this determination, the Court should specify four determinations, and do so in a single order: (1) that the Government has rebutted the presumption of immunity attached to the defendant’s official communications with the Vice President (see supra pp. 49, 63-67, 77-74; ECF No. 226 ¶¶ 11(c), 67, 70-78, 80, 82, and 84); and (2) that the remaining conduct described in Section I (that is, conduct other than the official communications with the Vice President) was not official, and, in the alternative, that the Government has rebutted any presumptive immunity for any of the remaining conduct that the Court finds to be official.  The Government requests alternative rulings regarding rebuttal for all conduct the Court finds to be unofficial, to buttress the Court’s record, ensure thorough and efficient appellate review, and minimize the risk of successive rounds of interlocutory appeal.

Furthermore, based on the determination that all the conduct described in Section I is not immune from prosecution, and because Section I encompasses all the allegations in the superseding indictment, the Court should further specify: (3) that the defendant is subject to trial on the superseding indictment; and (4) that the Government is not prohibited at trial from using evidence of the conduct described in Section I, subject at a later date to non-immunity based objections and this Court’s admissibility rulings under the Federal Rules of Evidence.

This is the end stage of a republic that has long since failed to deliver on the promise of a better future: a cartoonishly corrupt, criminal, carnival barking charlatan demagogue using populist rhetoric to inflame passions, with no plans in office other than to enrich himself and seek retribution against his enemies.  

Trump didn’t break this system; he is exploiting a broken system to his advantage.  He’s on the verge of overthrowing that broken system in its entirety to replace it with an even more corrupt, unjust, dictatorial, arbitrary and cronyist system meant only to advance his singular goals and ambitions.

""You've said a couple of times now that the White House has provided thorough medical records for the President...I'm not sure that was a full account necessarily and Dr. O'Connor in the memo described the president as ""a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the presidency.""

AUDIENCE QUESTION: Thank you so much for coming to Michigan. My name is Ashley and I work at the Chrysler plant. Like many auto workers, I am deeply concerned about the future of our industry. With many jobs being outsourced as we speak, what action will you take to ensure that our jobs stay in America so we can continue to build the best cars in the world here in Michigan?


DONALD TRUMP: So, pretty much as we’ve been saying, and what I want to do is I want to be able to — Look, your business — Years ago in this area, I was honored as the man of the year. It was maybe 20 years ago. Oh, and the fake news heard about it. They said, it never happened. It never happened. And I didn’t know who it was. It was a group that honored me as man of the year. The fakers back there, see the fake news. But they said — They said, oh — And they looked and, you know, they said it never happened. But I said, I swear to you, it happened.


It did happen. I was man of the year. And I came and I made a speech and I said, why do you allow them to take your car business away? Why do you allow it to happen? They’re taking your business away. And I didn’t know too much about it. All I know is they were taking your car industry away from you. They said it never happened.


And lo and behold, somebody said, I remember the event. And then we found out and we had everything. We got the awards. We had everything. It did happen. But I gave a speech, which at the time was pretty controversial. We can’t let them take your car business away. It’s such an important business.


And you know it’s an important business even in times of war where they switch over. And it was really something. And I looked at that speech from, I don’t know, it’s like 19, 20 years ago. And I could repeat it now without changing a word.


You cannot let foreign countries, and a lot of the times our worst foes are our so-called friends, okay? You know, our friends, the European Union takes tremendous advantage of us. As an example, they give us cars by the millions. We don’t have too many Chevrolets in the middle of European cities, okay? European Union is brutal. They don’t take our farm products for the most part. They don’t take a lot. But unlike Kamala, who always complains and doesn’t do anything, I keep saying, why don’t you do?


I saw Marsha the other day. Why doesn’t she, why didn’t she do it four years ago almost? And I say that, you know, she’s on the border today trying just to, what a day for the border. She goes to the border today, and they just announced just before she got up to speak that more than 13,000 murderers from jail, solitary confinement people in many cases, were released.


But I just say, let’s go back. So we can’t let them take our businesses. And we’re not gonna let them take our businesses. And you can control that so easily through good policy. Not her kind of policy, by the way. She changed her policy 15 times. No fracking. Oh, I like fracking. Defund the police. She wants to defund the police. Now, oh, I love the police all of a sudden. By the way, when anybody is into defunding the police even for a day during their career, they can no longer serve as President of the United States, I can tell you.


So we’re not gonna let them take our businesses. And really, a lot of that’s determined by our taxation policy. When China has to pay all that money, the people that liked me the best were the steel companies because I saved them. They were dumping China and others, but mostly China was dumping steel in here at levels that nobody had ever seen before.


And it was putting the steel companies out of business. I put a 50% and 100% tax on the dumping of steel and the steel companies thrived. I saved them, and you have to have the steel companies. So we’ll do the same thing.


And you don’t worry about it. Here’s what you have to do. I only ask you to do one thing, and then you can sleep beautifully all night long, go to a job you love, and get a lot of money at the end of the week. You know what the thing is? Vote for Trump. If you vote for Trump, everything’s gonna be perfect.

Putin, petrified of the virus, accepted the supplies but took pains to prevent political fallout — not for him, but for his American counterpart. He cautioned Trump not to reveal that he had dispatched the scarce medical equipment to Moscow, according to a new book by Washington Post associate editor [Bob Woodward](https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/bob-woodward/?itid=lk_inline_manual_4).

Putin, according to the book, told Trump, “I don’t want you to tell anybody because people will get mad at you, not me.”

Four years later, the personal relationship between the two men appears to have persisted, Woodward reports, as Trump campaigns to return to the White House and Putin orchestrates his bloody assault on Ukraine. In early 2024, the former president ordered an aide away from his office at Mar-a-Lago, his private club and residence in Florida, so he could conduct a private phone call with the Russian leader, according to Woodward’s account.

"***From Rolling Stone's Nikki McCann Ramirez:***

Election conspiracy theorist Tina Peters has been convicted of tampering with voting machines in Mesa County, Colorado, in the aftermath of the 2020 election. On Monday, Peters was found guilty of seven charges related to her efforts to grant unauthorized individuals access to country voting machines in order to prove false claims that the election had been fraudulently stolen from Donald Trump.

In March, Peters pleaded not guilty to 10 criminal charges, including seven felonies, in connection to a scheme to use her position as Mesa County clerk to transfer voting data from the machines to allies of former President Trump. She resigned from her role as Mesa County clerk in 2023.

Peters’ sentencing is scheduled to take place on October 3.

“This community has suffered greatly from the dishonesty, lack of transparency and refusal of Ms. Peters to take accountability,” Mesa County District Attorney Daniel P. Rubinstein said in response to the verdict. “No single elected official, or even branch of government, is above the law or should be allowed to act without those checks and balances.”

"There's a demonstrative double standard here.

You may or may not be surprised to know how often Trump, his cronies, co-conspirators, and allies have lied or attempted to obstruct justice during investigations over the last eight years.

Yet, the MAGA crowd either remains silent or they drum up whatever rationalization/conspiracy theory imaginable to defend Republican corruption. What's worse, they then try desperately to turn it around and make the criminals out to be the victims.

But God have mercy if Joe Biden, or any Democrat for that matter, is even rumored to have misspoken.

The ensuing hysteria just shows how hypocritical and dishonest they've become.

They expect to be handed a hall pass. They demand immunities, empowered by the fact that so much of their misconduct has become practically legitimized as of late.

And more and more, Republicans are saying the quiet part out loud. They're much less subtle now about their attitude that only *they* are entitled to the god given rights and freedoms afforded to them, that only *they* are entitled to privileges and immunities.

Which is exactly why Trump and his supporters cry often and loudly that Democrats are undermining and persecuting *them*, that Democrats are ""weaponizing the justice system"" against *them*.

But in reality, Republicans have been the ones targeting their opponents with fruitless, politically motivated investigations that have wasted time, energy and resources, when in reality, it's Republicans, and especially Trump, who continuously threaten to abuse their power to seek swift retribution against their perceived political opponents, ""the deep state,"" all of their naysayers in the media, ""radical leftists,"" judges, journalists, congressmen, anyone who has tried to hold Trump accountable for that matter, all those involved in ""stealing"" the election from him, and even civil servants, among others of course.

Think about the general tenor of this last election. The bar for Trump and his MAGA allies remained and still remains shockingly low in comparison to the high standards that Americans expect of Democrats.

The media and the general public have played a hand in normalizing and sane-washing Trump's criminal behavior and misconduct. His absurdity has magically rendered him benign. He's made so many unconstitutional, unhinged remarks and anti-democratic threats, that many Americans stopped taking him seriously. 

But Trump is not benign, he's an idiot, yes, but a useful one. And his incompetence, his narcissism, his mental instability and his authoritarian impulses will go unchecked come next term. While his coalition of MAGA loyalists won't hesitate to take advantage of him in order to push their far right agendas and consolidate power for the foreseeable future.",1734034027.0,m1qucyk

"So a recap: 

1. Elon pledges his support for Donald Trump, along with $45 million dollar donation per month to a Trump super PAC until election day.

2. Elon throttles the number of followers for Kamala Harris' twitter account, preventing more people from seeing her latest tweets. 

3. Elon Musk puts his own tweets as top priority in the algorithm, so you always see his tweets regardless if you follow him or not.


4. Elon shares a fake Kamala Harris political ad that was AI generated and got over 120 million views.

6. Elon bans White Dudes for Harris because they were drawing in money for Harris' campaign. 

7. Elon regularly allows hate speech (like racism and misogyny) on his platform and allows it to be used against individuals he doesn't like, such as Kamala Harris. When negative posts are directed at him over proven facts, such as the nature of his family fortune, those users are banned because ""defamation is not free speech."" So in Elon's mind, it's okay to spew hate speech against groups of people or against individuals he doesn't like, but not him. 

8. Elon shares and comments on anti-vaccine disinformation and blames Democrats.

9. Elon continues to tweet and retweet anti-LGBT rhetoric and misogyny, and treats his bigotry and opinions as facts while banning others who try to support LGBT individuals, including his own daughter.

Thirteen former Trump White House officials signed an open letter backing up former Trump chief of staff John Kelly, who told the New York Times that Trump fits the definition of a fascist.

>“We applaud General Kelly for highlighting in stark details the danger of a second Trump term. Like General Kelly, we did not take the decision to come forward lightly,” the letter said. “We are all lifelong Republicans who served our country. However, there are moments in history where it becomes necessary to put country over party. This is one of those moments.”

>The letter, released by the Harris campaign, is signed by former officials including former press secretary Stephanie Grisham, former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security Miles Taylor, and Olivia Troye, former national security adviser to Mike Pence. All three former Trump administration officials have become high-profile critics of his after his presidency ended.

>In his interview with the Times, released Tuesday, Kelly also said he observed Trump on multiple occasions praising Adolf Hitler. His comments came on the [same day the Atlantic reported](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/10/trump-military-generals-hitler/680327/) that Trump said he wished he had generals like Hitler.

>In their letter, the former Trump officials said Kelly’s claims were “disturbing and shocking.” They added that “because we know Trump and have worked for and alongside him, we were sadly not surprised by what General Kelly had to say. This is who Donald Trump is.”

"Said this in another thread about this topic that got deleted but here’s my thoughts:

I think a lot of people are missing the message that Bernie and more progressive members have signaled and it’s that Dems haven’t truly passed bold country changing legislation since LBJ and the new deal era of Democratic policy. During that time, Dems restructured the banking system, strengthened government over site and penalties for corporations, raised minimum wage with the cost of living, created social security, created Medicare and Medicaid, housing act of 1949, creation of FHA, and increased stabilization of prices through federal over site post WW2. Whenever older republicans talk about the good old days they’re talking about days of very progressive Democratic legislation.  

 With all of that said the 1980s was the end of New Deal Dems and more adoption of certain Neo Liberal stances such as NAFTA, smaller federal spending, and tax incentives to direct corporations. The last legislation that could have truly revolutionized the U.S. and probably rivaled that of SS, Medicare, etc. was the ACA and this is where I think the working class once again lost trust in Dems. 

We failed to hold those accountable for the 2008 financial crisis and then the Public Option was stripped from the final version of the ACA which imo was the single largest portion of that bill. Then the courts stripped the mandatory expanded medicaid requirement. Then you look at policy positions voters have been clamoring for for more than two decades (Expansion of Medicare, Paid family leave, increasing federal minimum wage, and banning Super PACs/corporate money from politics) and we just don’t move on it.   Imo these are policy positions they need to run on because traditionally, Dems have dominated politics when they have bold ideas. Right now Dems to the electorate just seems like the status quo. Obviously there’s nuance like the right wing media machine and other things, but the point still stands.
I’m not sure I even self Identify as a progressive Democrat and I still think Biden passed some absolutely consequential legislation and did help the working class in many ways, but it’s obvious voters feel Dems missed the mark where it mattered most: “what are you gonna do to make my life easier?”",1731272153.0,lwh0eom

Barbara Pierce Bush, the daughter of former President George W. Bush and granddaughter of former President George H.W. Bush, spent part of her weekend in Pennsylvania campaigning for Vice President Kamala Harris with just days to go before the 2024 presidential election.

""It was inspiring to join friends and meet voters with the Harris-Walz campaign in Pennsylvania this weekend,"" Barbara, 42, shares in an exclusive statement to PEOPLE on Tuesday, Oct. 29. ""I’m hopeful they'll move our country forward and protect women’s rights.""

Barbara’s Republican father served as president from 2001 to 2009. Her mother, former first lady Laura Bush, 77, broke with the party’s stance in 2010 by saying she supports same-sex marriage and abortion. At the time, Laura said abortion should ""remain legal, because I think it's important for people, for medical reasons and other reasons.

While Laura and George, 78, have not weighed in on the 2024 presidential election, George’s vice president Dick Cheney stunned the nation by sharing that he plans to vote for Harris. Cheney’s daughter, former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, also endorsed Harris, 60, and has campaigned with the vice president.""

But in this case, it’s just gotten worse. The ship is capsizing, and the captain is losing his marbles.

Right after that story ran, Trump came out with his wild accusation that Kamala Harris’s crowd of thousands at a Detroit airplane hangar was fake. The next night, he did that weird, to borrow an au courant word, interview with Elon Musk, where he made more WTF comments than I can recount, capped by his vow to move to Venezuela (a country ruled by a corrupt autocrat who just cheated massively in this month’s election) if he loses. On Wednesday, he gave a rambling speech at a North Carolina rally.

Then, on Thursday, we had a little taste of some [peak Trump crazy](https://newrepublic.com/post/184939/donald-trump-derails-press-conference-campaign-strategy). He claimed Harris is responsible for [a law in California](https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-160551360299) that says [it’s OK to steal](https://x.com/atrupar/status/1824188075989155864) from a grocery store as long as your take is under $950.

He made strange comments about Cheerios. He lectured Jews (at a later event) about how if the Democrats win, Jewish people “don’t have a chance” in America, [saying of Harris](https://www.katv.com/news/beyond-the-podium/jewish-voices-for-trump-coalition-formed-to-combat-antisemitism-2024-presidential-election-politics)—whose husband is Jewish—that “she doesn’t like Jewish people. You know it, I know it, and everybody knows it, and nobody wants to say it.” And we can’t forget the assertion that more than 100 percent of recent U.S. jobs have gone to migrants.

Meanwhile, what else is Harris doing? Starting to unveil an economic package that, so far anyway, looks pretty great. It’s aimed straight at middle-class voters and focused on housing and grocery prices. You can’t get more kitchen table than that. And the bit about [going after corporate price gougers](https://newrepublic.com/article/184937/harris-price-gouging-corporations) is great. It sends a nice populist signal that she’s willing to make some enemies.

We’re coming up on a month now of Harris being the candidate. That isn’t much time, granted, and of course the race is still in margin-of-error territory and at some point

But all that said, the Harris campaign has been as shrewd as any presidential campaign I’ve ever seen. Her stump speech is excellent. The choice of Walz was great—their personal chemistry is so evident in that video they just released of the two of them chatting about spicy food and whatnot (the right is trying to gin up outrage over Walz saying he eats “white-guy tacos”).

>“‘So we all end up in the same place’? Doesn’t this sound like we’re all going to end up in a gulag?” Levin said. He called equity a “prescription for tyranny and totalitarianism,” ranting that it was “not the government’s job” to improve the quality of life of American citizens.

The response to the letter was more than passing strange. Other mental health professionals rose to denounce the letter and its signatories. One was Allen Frances, the prestigious chairman of the task force that wrote the “Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV”, considered psychiatry’s diagnostic bible. Dr Frances had two problems with the letter. The first was, he said, that Trump was too successful to be mentally ill – a bizarre argument that sounded like one Trump would make himself. “Mr. Trump,” Dr. Frances intoned, “causes severe distress rather than experiencing it and has been richly rewarded, rather than punished, for his grandiosity, self-absorption and lack of empathy.” 

Therefore Trump could not possibly be mentally ill, Frances concluded, apparently unaware of erratic politicians in world history who have achieved success in the exact terms defined by their insanity. Frances added, with an apparently unintentional touch of humour, that pronouncing Trump mentally ill was an insult to the mentally ill.

Reacting to the negative backlash, the Times then published an article about the controversy by Richard Friedman, a psychiatrist. Friedman referred to what is known in American psychiatry as the Goldwater rule. This was the American Psychiatric Association’s official prohibition against mental health professionals making a public diagnosis of a politician’s mental health. That edict itself was a response to mental health professionals participating, in 1964, in a public survey and judging then Republican candidate for president, Barry Goldwater, mentally unfit to be president. Siding with the APA, Friedman finished by declaring that clinically judging Trump to be mentally ill would let him “off the moral hook”. And from that point on, liberal attacks on Trump were unfailingly moral, a tactic that soon degenerated into a grossly ineffectual torrent of moral hubris, virtue-mongering and sanctimony.

There are, of course, sound reasons to resist declaring Trump mentally unsound. At this late moment in American civilisation, the concept of mental illness is nearly impossible to clarify. When I wrote, in 2017, about the dust-up over whether Trump should be publicly diagnosed, my very own therapist at the time paused in the middle of one of our sessions to scold me for doing so. The weapon of psychological stigma can be used, like impeachment, against any rival or adversary. In 2011, a psychologist named Drew Westen enraged people by publishing, again in the Times, a lengthy essay arguing, in effect, that Obama did not have the “character” to be president (a “deep-seated aversion to conflict”; “tic-like gestures of compromise”).

It could well be that the debate over whether it was acceptable to call Trump mentally unfit to be president is at the heart of the weird debate over who is more weird, the Democrats or the Republicans. America is becoming unrecognisable, so fast, in so many ways, to so many different types of people, that the words “weird” and “sick” are being anxiously domesticated into neutral terms of description. Yet, in the end, the unclarity is all the more reason to be vigilant about truly aberrant figures slipping into leadership of the country under the cover of a revolution of norms. Trump is truly aberrant. Everyone knows it, his supporters as much as his detractors. No one talks like this man. No one abuses other people like this man. No one misrepresents reality like this man. And he is not lying. He is describing what he perceives, which is not what is actually there.

Biden’s relational skills, his empathy, his moral perception of reality were never the issue. He had been, by all appearances and accounts, a mentally stable man all his life. That is why his cognitive decline became so apparent, once his entourage stopped shielding him. It is harder to discern Trump’s cognitive decline, because his behaviour, ironically, serves the same purpose as Biden’s entourage, obscuring the decline it is a symptom of. But anyone watching him abruptly change subjects in his acceptance speech at the Republican convention, anyone who listened to that speech and watched him disappear into the rabbit hole of his own mind, can see that he is even further along in his deterioration than Biden.

The liberal media cried wolf in 2016, and now they are afraid to ring the alarm bells when it is vital to ring them. After January 6 and the spectacle of watching the effects of Trump’s “personal myth of greatness” being challenged, now is the time to apply the same scrutiny of Trump’s mental condition that was applied to Biden – the appearance of throwing stones from glass houses be damned. Having been criticised for questioning Trump’s sanity in 2017, and despite the daily evidence that Trump’s faculties are clearly degenerating, the ferociously partisan liberal press wishes to present itself as dignified and above the fray. Yet what was good for the octogenarian gander with declining faculties but an intact moral centre should be equally good for the septuagenarian gander with declining faculties and a pathologically absent moral centre. The great blessing in life, and the great curse, is that people can get used to just about anything. That inborn tendency is now, with regard to Trump’s unstable mind, a curse.",1725299289.0,ll6g2ho

"Don't give Newsweek the click by reading the article.

Check 538 for Florida Atlantic University PolCom Lab/Main Street Research recent polling on Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania conducted May 30-31. 

The polling sample size for Wisconsin is poor which leads to stupid results like Trump leading 41%-40% with 290 likely voters but when JFK Jr is included Trump drops like a rock with those same 290 likely voters.

Pennsylvania polling uses a larger sample size which tightens the race though Trump still leads in registered and likely voters when it's a head to head match up between Trump and Biden.  With RFK Jr included that lead switches to Biden marginally leading Trump.

Michigan polling shows Trump leading again in a head to head match but, like Pennsylvania, Biden marginally leads Trump with RFK Jr included.

"> In her dissent, Sotomayor wrote that the majority’s opinion will now protect this exact type of conduct.

>“The president of the United States is the most powerful person in the country, and possibly the world,” wrote Sotomayor. “When he uses his official powers in any way, under the majority’s reasoning, he now will be insulated from criminal prosecution. Orders the Navy’s Seal Team 6 to assassinate a political rival? Immune. Organizes a military coup to hold onto power? Immune. Takes a bribe in exchange for a pardon? Immune. Immune, immune, immune.”

edit: from the majority:

>(3) Presidents cannot be indicted based on conduct for which they are immune from prosecution. On remand, the District Court must carefully analyze the indictment’s remaining allegations to determine whether they too involve conduct for which a President must be immune from prosecution. And the parties and the District Court must ensure that sufficient allegations support the indictment’s charges without such conduct. **Testimony or private records of the President or his advisers probing such conduct may not be admitted as evidence at trial.** Pp. 30–32

An incredible amount of evidence of a president's criminal acts are inadmissible to the Supreme Court! What this means:

>Finally, Roberts does concede that the president may be prosecuted for “unofficial” acts. So, for example, if Trump had personally attempted to shoot and kill then-presidential candidate Joe Biden in the lead-up to the 2020 election, rather than ordering a subordinate to do so, then Trump could probably be prosecuted for murder.

>But even this caveat to Roberts’s sweeping immunity decision is not very strong. Roberts writes that “in dividing official from unofficial conduct, courts may not inquire into the President’s motives.” And Roberts even limits the ability of prosecutors to pursue a president who accepts a bribe in return for committing an official act, such as pardoning a criminal who pays off the president. In Roberts’s words, a prosecutor may not “admit testimony or private records of the President or his advisers probing the official act itself.”

>That means that, [while the president can be prosecuted for an “unofficial” act, the prosecutors may not prove that he committed this crime using evidence drawn from the president’s “official” actions.](https://www.vox.com/scotus/358292/supreme-court-trump-immunity-dictatorship)

>The practical implications of this ruling are astounding. As Justice Sonia Sotomayor writes in a dissenting opinion, “imagine a President states in an official speech that he intends to stop a political rival from passing legislation that he opposes, no matter what it takes to do so,” it follows from Roberts’s opinion that the ensuing murder indictment “could include no allegation of the President’s public admission of premeditated intent to support” the proposition that the president intended to commit murder.",1719846115.0,lb4w5j4

In every use of official power, the President is now a king above the law.”

A lot of things from supply chains to war to stimulus money pushed up inflation in the US, but that stimulus, along with IRA, CHIPS, Infra, etc, also were a long-term play to ensure the economy didn't crash. And it didn't.
* Now pivot to how strong the economy is now. Yes prices for many things are still high, but workers wages are up too. It still feels bad to look at the price tags. But if you look at the numbers, Americans ARE better off today.

[Senate election in Arizona 2024](https://ballotpedia.org/United_States_Senate_election_in_Arizona,_2024)

[Mark Lamb](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Lamb_(sheriff)) is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and became American law-enforcement Sheriff in 2017.

He wrote American Sheriff: Traditional Values in a Modern World. Lamb is a supporter of the Stop the Steal movement. He spoke at a rally where he said the riot was not Trump's fault but rather caused by ""the other issues that have happened – the Hillary Clintons that have gone unpunished"".He later described the rioters as ""very loving, Christian people.""

In 2020, Lamb spoke at a convention of the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, an organization that holds the fringe legal theory that sheriffs are the supreme legal authority in the United States and are not required to enforce laws they believe to be unconstitutional.

[Ruben Gallego](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruben_Gallego) 3rd Battalion, 25th Marines. Attended Harvard University and earned a Bachelor of Arts in international relations. 

His first successful bill passed in 2011 it granted in-state tuition status to veterans residing in Arizona. Gallego supported the repeal of Arizona SB 1070. He wrote They Called Us ""Lucky"": The Life and Afterlife of the Iraq War's Hardest Hit Unit, published in 2021. 

Gallego founded the group Citizens for Professional Law Enforcement with the goal of recalling Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, citing Arpaio's immigration policies and his use of taxpayer money to investigate Barack Obama's citizenship.

We have two seats in the [Arizona Supreme Court](https://ballotpedia.org/Arizona_Supreme_Court_elections,_2024) up for election on November 5, 2024. The Justices up for retention election are Clint Bolick and Kathryn Hackett King. If retained, they will serve six year terms. Gov. Doug Ducey (R) appointed both justices to the supreme court. Heading into the election, Republican governors originally appointed all seven members.

The Democratic candidate has backed raising the current minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to at least $15. 

It has remained frozen for the last 15 years: the longest stretch without an increase since standard pay was introduced in 1938.

She told NBC: “At least $15 an hour, but we’ll work with Congress, right? It’s something that is going through Congress.”

In the same interview, on Tuesday evening, Ms Harris distanced herself from Joe Biden’s economic record and said she would take a more aggressive stance on lowering costs for Americans.

Your gas will be $1 because no one gives a fuck about gas when you have no job, no house, no retirement and no money after your president destroyed the economy.

"The last few days could not have been any more of a nightmare for Trump world, given how unexpectedly well-executed this pivot has been for the Democrats. I don't think anyone predicted it could go this well:

* Dems have immediately unified behind Harris and practically ended their infighting. Any cracks in the first 48 hours could have been fatal, but it's clear that the party is rock solid behind this.
* Harris is much improved as a speaker compared to even a few years ago, and is ready to meet the moment, and serve as a perfect foil for the opponent she is facing. Her initial speeches have been well received, and she's already hit on a slogan that's resonating with voters (""We're not going back"").
* The Democrat base has done a complete 180, and is now super energised and raring to go. Trump is relying on demoralised Dem voters and depressed turnout to win. This is the single biggest threat to Trump, more so than any individual candidate, and could well prove fatal for him if Dems can keep this momentum going to election day.
* Harris has managed to raise a huge amount of money in just a couple of days. The Trump campaign had *just* caught up with Biden in campaign funds, and are now lagging behind again.
* Trump is going to have to waste a good chunk of that money redoing his entire campaign, because it was fully geared around shitting on Biden specifically, rather than promoting any positive message about Trump (because there simply isn't one).
* The GOP apparently did not prepare for this scenario at all, despite egging it on for a long time, and are struggling to align on a narrative against Harris.
* Any possible bounce from the shooting and RNC has been wiped out by coverage of Biden>Harris. That Trump didn't really get a bounce from the shooting suggests he has hit probably his hard ceiling, meanwhile Harris is starting from a roughly even position with him with plenty of room to grow.
* Trump's arrogance led him to think he had the election in the bag, and has now lumbered himself with a strategically poor and unpopular VP pick.

There's still a monumental task ahead, and it's absolutely not going to be a sure thing, but I don't think the past couple of days could have gone any better for Kamala Harris.

"No surprise that Trump supporters, who are attacking Harris for the border, have no idea what she was actually tasked to do:

- In March 2021, when the Biden administration faced the early stages of an influx in illegal crossings at the U.S. southern border, Mr. Biden tasked Harris with leading the administration's diplomatic campaign to address the ""root causes"" of migration from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, including poverty, corruption and violence.

- In her immigration role, Harris' main line of work has focused on convincing companies to invest in Central America and promoting democracy and development there through diplomacy. In March of this year, the White House announced Harris had secured a commitment from the private sector to invest over $5 billion to promote economic opportunities and reduce violence in the region.

- In fiscal year 2023, for example, Border Patrol apprehensions of migrants from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador made up 22% of all crossings during that time period, down from 41% in fiscal year 2021, government statistics show.

"The New York Times editorial board on Monday endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, calling her “the only patriotic choice for president” while painting a grim picture of a second term for former President Donald Trump.

Rather than praise for its preferred candidate, the board led its endorsement of Harris by listing off disqualifying arguments against Trump. “It is hard to imagine a candidate more unworthy to serve as president of the United States,” the Times editorial board wrote.

“This unequivocal, dispiriting truth — Donald Trump is not fit to be president — should be enough for any voter who cares about the health of our country and the stability of our democracy to deny him re-election,” the board, made up of 14 opinion journalists, wrote. “For this reason, regardless of any political disagreements voters might have with her, Kamala Harris is the only patriotic choice for president.”

The endorsement of Harris is unsurprising — the editorial board has not backed a Republican for president since Dwight Eisenhower in 1956 — though still important given the paper’s influence. In July, 10 days before President Joe Biden left the race (and after the board called on him to do so), the board published a five-part, scathing editorial against Trump that struck many of the same chords as Monday’s story.",1727702003.0,lpn8634

Earlier in the day, CBS News proposed four dates for a debate between the two vice presidential nominees: Sept. 17, Sept. 24, Oct. 1, and Oct. 8. The Harris-Walz campaign soon agreed to the Oct. 1 date.

""See you on October 1, JD,"" Walz wrote on X.

A date for the vice presidential debate has been in limbo since the spring, when CBS News first extended the invitation to both presidential campaigns. In May, President Biden's campaign said Vice President Kamala Harris, who was still his running mate at the time, was willing to face off against the eventual Republican vice presidential nominee on either July 23 or Aug. 13.

"It has fallen to me, the humor columnist, to endorse Harris for president -- Isn't this what a newspaper is supposed to do?

Alexandra Petri


The Washington Post is not bothering to endorse a candidate in the 2024 presidential election. (Jeff Bezos, the founder of Blue Origin and the founder and executive chairman of Amazon and Amazon Web Services, also owns The Post.)

We as a newspaper suddenly remembered, less than two weeks before the election, that we had a robust tradition 50 years ago of not telling anyone what to do with their vote for president. It is time we got back to those “roots,” I’m told!

Roots are important, of course. As recently as the 1970s, The Post did not endorse a candidate for president. As recently as centuries ago, there was no Post and the country had a king! Go even further back, and the entire continent of North America was totally uninhabitable, and we were all spineless creatures who lived in the ocean, and certainly there were no Post subscribers.

But if I were the paper, I would be a little embarrassed that it has fallen to me, the humor columnist, to make our presidential endorsement. I will spare you the suspense: I am endorsing Kamala Harris for president, because I like elections and want to keep having them.

Let me tell you something. I am having a baby (It’s a boy!), and he is expected on Jan. 6, 2025 (It’s a … Proud Boy?). This is either slightly funny or not at all funny. This whole election, I have been lurching around, increasingly heavily pregnant, nauseated, unwieldy, full of the commingled hopes and terrors that come every time you are on the verge of introducing a new person to the world.

Well, that world will look very different, depending on the outcome of November’s election, and I care which world my kid gets born into. I also live here myself. And I happen to care about the people who are already here, in this world. Come to think of it, I have a lot of reasons for caring how the election goes. I think it should be obvious that this is not an election for sitting out.

The case for Donald Trump is “I erroneously think the economy used to be better? I know that he has made many ominous-sounding threats about mass deportations, going after his political enemies, shutting down the speech of those who disagree with him (especially media outlets), and that he wants to make things worse for almost every category of person — people with wombs, immigrants, transgender people, journalists, protesters, people of color — but … maybe he’ll forget.”

“But maybe he’ll forget” is not enough to hang a country on!

Embarrassingly enough, I like this country. But everything good about it has been the product of centuries of people who had no reason to hope for better but chose to believe that better things were possible, clawing their way uphill — protesting, marching, voting, and, yes, doing the work of journalism — to build this fragile thing called democracy. But to be fragile is not the same as to be perishable, as G.K. Chesterton wrote. Simply do not break a glass, and it will last a thousand years. Smash it, and it will not last an instant. Democracy is like that: fragile, but only if you shatter it.

Trust is like that, too, as newspapers know.

I’m just a humor columnist. I only know what’s happening because our actual journalists are out there reporting, knowing that their editors have their backs, that there’s no one too powerful to report on, that we would never pull a punch out of fear. That’s what our readers deserve and expect: that we are saying what we really think, reporting what we really see; that if we think Trump should not return to the White House and Harris would make a fine president, we’re going to be able to say so.

That’s why I, the humor columnist, am endorsing Kamala Harris by myself!",1729994092.0,lty2z3a

And let's not forget Trump pardoned some of the worst people in America:

> Indeed, by any fair measure, Trump’s record on pardons is arguably the worst in American history. During his first term, he effectively wielded his pardon power as a corrupt weapon, rewarding loyalists, completing cover-ups, undermining federal law enforcement, and doling out perverse favors to the politically connected.

“I’ll find you in criminal contempt for the tenth time,” Merchan said in a stark tone. “It appears that the $1,000 fines are not serving as a deterrent. Therefore, going forward, this court will have to consider a jail sanction. Mr. Trump, it’s important to understand the last thing I was to do is put you in jail. You are the former president of the United States, and possibly the next one as well.”",1715002866.0,l2tubb9

"This news is being overshadowed by the debate, but the Supreme Court overturning the Chevron deference is one of the most consequential decisions that will affect our political system and our systems of checks and balances for decades to come. The Supreme Court just gave itself the most amount of power since 1803, when it gave itself the sole power to decide whether laws are constitutional or not:

> The US Constitution, flawed though it is, has already answered the question of who gets to decide how to enforce our laws. The Constitution says, quite clearly, that Congress passes laws and the president enforces them. The Supreme Court, constitutionally speaking, has no role in determining whether Congress was right to pass the law, or if the executive branch is right to enforce it, or how presidents should use the authority granted to them by Congress.

> For an unelected panel of judges to come in, above the agencies, and tell them how the president is allowed to enforce laws, is a perversion of the constitutional order and separation of powers—and a repudiation of democracy itself.",1719614301.0,lar0gsf

Madison. Through the now-customary 6–3 vote delivered by the carefully manufactured conservative majority, the precedent of Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council, aka the Chevron deference, is now as dead as Julius Caesar. And thus forty years of administrative law comes to a rude and abrupt end.

"The point I’ve been making is that a lot of what we dislike now - the inflation, the housing prices, the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, and so on - where we’re rightfully angry at Biden for not doing more or doing the right thing: a lot of it is happening *now* because we let Trump win in 2016.

Trump weakened NATO and gave Putin the green light to invade Ukraine. Trump sided with Netanyahu and helped to kettle the Palestinians, pulled out of the Iran deal, alienated the Iranian regime by assassinating a high-level official, and set the stage that led to Hamas’s attack on Israel. Trump juiced interest rates during a growing economy and handed out tax cuts for the rich, and those bills are coming due now. He pulled out of the Paris Accords and severely undermined the global effort to fight climate change. 

So here we are. Things suck, but they suck *because of Trump*. Things suck because we as a nation decided that Hillary didn’t “deserve” the job, wasn’t likeable or inspiring, didn’t run a good campaign. We told ourselves that Trump and Hillary were basically the same, so we voted for protest candidates or stayed home. And now we have a genocide in Gaza. People are right to be angry about the things Biden isn’t doing that he could definitely be doing *today* to put an end to it. But we wouldn’t even be here if we had made Hillary president when we had the chance.

Biden could be doing a better job of handling the suck, but it is *virtually guaranteed* that a second Trump term will only bring us back to where we are now, in another several years. Trump will wreck the economy to serve his interests, he’ll weaken America on the global stage, and then we’ll vote him out - only to be frustrated again that the guy after him *also* doesn’t solve all the issues Trump caused.

"You know what, here is the op-ed:

>*Jim Parrott is co-owner of Parrott Ryan Advisors and a nonresident fellow at the Urban Institute. Mark Zandi is chief economist of Moody’s Analytics.*

>The cost of housing has rarely been higher or more painful for so many Americans. Since the pandemic hit, rents are up about 20 percent, forcing half of all renters to spend more than 30 percent of their monthly income on rent, the highest number on record. And with home prices up 50 percent and mortgage rates up almost 100 percent, the monthly payment for a median-priced house has more than doubled, from $1,000 to $2,250. A home that was affordable only a few years ago is well out of reach now.

>The strain this is putting on families is doing significant damage to the economy. If not for the ever-increasing cost of housing, inflation would have returned to the Federal Reserve’s target almost a year ago, and it would have long since begun cutting interest rates. It’s a serious impediment to savings, making it difficult for many to cover everyday expenses, much less save for their kids’ college or a down payment on a home. And it constrains labor mobility, making the economy less resilient against shocks.

>The cause of the rising cost of housing is not a mystery: We simply don’t have enough affordable homes for rent or for sale. We have enough homes at the top of the market — homes that wealthy families can afford. But we don’t have enough homes for sale that aspiring homeowners can afford, or enough to rent that working families can afford. We estimate that, all told, the nation is short approximately 3 million homes, almost entirely in the bottom half of the market.

>Given this unmet demand, why haven’t developers built more of these homes? Because the numbers don’t add up. For a mix of reasons dating back to the financial crisis and worsened by the pandemic, the cost of land, labor and materials has risen to levels that make it all but impossible for most builders to make an adequate profit on affordable housing.

>The solution is to change these economics.

>This is at the heart of the housing proposal released last week by Vice President Kamala Harris, which lays out a set of tax breaks with which the numbers for building affordable housing would finally pencil out.

>To incentivize building affordable rental housing, Harris would expand a tax break for developers known as the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit. LIHTC has been a critical source of financing for affordable rental housing for almost 40 years. While it is not perfect — not all of the subsidy goes into units that would not otherwise be built — it has broad political support, can be scaled up quickly and distributes the tax break equitably nationwide.

>Harris also proposes creating a comparable tax break for builders to address the shortfall in affordable homes for purchase. Policymakers have largely ignored this shortfall, focusing instead on demand-side support for homeownership that alone would do little to help in a supply-constrained market such as the one we have today. Under the new proposal, home builders would get a tax break on profits made from homes built and sold to first-time home buyers. As with LITHC, this would increase the returns for builders and developers to focus on the lower-income side of the market.

>Finally, Harris proposes a new tax credit for renovating homes that can’t be sold for enough to cover the cost of repairing them. This would help bring to the market homes long languishing in neighborhoods that have fallen into disrepair.

>These three moves would provide enough incentive for developers to tackle the supply shortfall across much of the country. In some areas, however, lack of infrastructure or political ambivalence over the additional density needed would still stand in the way. Harris thus proposes significant funds for states and communities to overcome local hurdles to building more affordable housing, making it easier for communities to get behind the projects needed to make up the shortfall.

>Each of these moves would be meaningful on its own, but together they would amount to the most aggressive supply-side push since the national investment in housing that followed World War II. As one would expect from an effort of this scale, it is not cheap. The supply-side measures in Harris’s proposal would cost an estimated $125 billion, a hefty tab that must be paid with spending cuts or taxes, since adding to the federal deficit would drive up mortgage rates and undermine the very housing affordability effort it’s paying for.

>*Any effort* adequate to the scale of this challenge will be expensive, however, and pale in comparison to the long-term cost of letting the nation’s housing shortfall deepen. Our lack of affordable housing will continue to depress savings, opportunity and growth in ways that will do long-term harm to the nation’s economy. A thoughtful effort to address the problem now will ultimately lead to more growth and less cost.

>For all the controversy Harris’s plan will likely generate in an election year, it is precisely the sort of effort needed, both in its scope and its design. Indeed, it is one that both sides of the aisle should eventually find appealing, as it marshals the resources of the private sector to tackle a public policy challenge that plagues red and blue states alike. By making it economical to build the housing we need, it would finally end the decade-long shortfall, easing rents and home prices and the daunting weight that these ever-rising costs are putting on the nation’s economy.",1724541599.0,ljs1wxk

">Two Ohio grandparents, Mike and Melissa H., were both lifelong Republican voters, but they recently left the GOP because its anti-transgender politics threaten the well-being of their trans grandchild.

>“I just felt a real departure from the Republican Party. I got some mailings from both the national Republican Party and the Ohio Republican Party, and I cut it up. I sent it back to them. I said, ‘I voted Republican most of my life, but until you change your policy and legislation on LGBTQ community, I’m not interested in supporting you,'” Mike said in a recent ad from the Human Rights Campaign.

>“I started to see how things were affecting my daughter’s family and grandson, who is transgender,” Mike said. His wife agreed.

>“It’s been very, very disappointing. It was a no-brainer. I’m voting Democrat, and it doesn’t take intelligence, it just takes compassion, whether you’re a grandparent, whether you’re a parent, an aunt or an uncle,” she said. “Everybody should be treated equal. It doesn’t matter color, race, gender. It’s just a travesty when you get the government involved with trying to legislate how we should feel.”

>The couple noted that only an estimated 0.7% of the U.S. population is made up of trans youth, and Mike believes the U.S. government should be more focused on resolving other larger social issues like homelessness or inflation.

>“I think it’s a waste to make it an issue,” Melissa said. “I wish there was more education. That’s how we’re going to change the mindset of society…. If you love your fellow human beings, You want the person who they are and accept them.”

I am glad that they came to support their family. We need stories like this more often.

I spent my youth being furious with this idea that an issue like this had to affect a Republican personally to make them change. As I got older, I became more understanding, a win is a win, all that. The problem is, gay people are a lot more common than trans people. If a personal connection is necessary to get 50% of the country to empathize with trans rights, it will never happen.",1721515137.0,le5a3hu

But immediately after that comment, a cameraman for NTD.com smartly panned the stadium, zooming in on sections of empty seats and people exiting the arena, although it’s unclear whether those attendees are leaving the venue entirely.

Hate crimes will spike (they did during his last administration, why wouldn’t they again with a campaign even more racist and dehumanizing than the last one?)

Protests will probably turn more violent as Trump has no one to talk him down from deploying the military against them like in his previous admin

Pollution will increase, city infrastructures will decay, public health will be threatened

1000s of career civil servants who have an expertise in their fields (lot of scientists and doctors) will be fired and/or replaced by Trump loyalists who have no clue what they’re doing or will work on behalf of the industry they’re supposed to regulate/preside over

Unions and workers rights will be challenged and likely weakened as Trump judicial appointments make new rulings

Abortion and birth control access are a big question mark imo, Trump really kinda went his own direction against the party line on it, but his judicial appointments will most likely make access to both of those harder depending on the state

Our nation’s influence will be weakened as foreign actors prey upon Trump’s ego and deep insecurities

China will fill the void we leave behind if Trump really goes for the isolationist foreign policy his supporters seem to want, people don’t seem to grasp that foreign aid is not really “foreign aid”, it’s an investment that helps us get something we want from a nation in exchange for an extremely small percentage of our budget

Bibi Netanyahu will get a greenlight to do whatever he wants, so the situation in the Middle East will probably get worse before it gets better

Depending on the emergency, most states (especially those with Democrat governors) will likely be on their own to handle the crisis just as we saw during covid and bc the Federal appointees will likely be people without any real experience/conspiracy theorists loyal to protecting Trump’s image over us, many Republicans also seem to not be in favor of giving FEMA the funding it needs on the Federal level

Can you just imagine the absolute shitstorm tantrum hurricane Nancy Mace or MTG would throw if they encountered a trans man in the bathroom that was actually just following this batshit rule?,1732246925.0,lyczzc3
"Better yet, have a bathroom for Democrats and a bathroom for Republicans. Let these GOP women see what it’s like sharing a bathroom with a real predator.",1732254355.0,lydgxzq
"Of course it's Nancy Mace who championed the bill, and of course it's after the first transgender woman is elected to Congress.

From Mace:

> Sarah McBride doesn’t get a say.

And there you have it, Mace is saying the quiet part out loud. This brief remark encapsulates the Republican party's platform. Only *they* are entitled to ""a say."" Only *they* are entitled to the god given rights afforded to them in the Constitution. *They* get to dictate your rights, and God have mercy if you have any ""say"" in the matter.

> This is a biological man trying to force himself into women’s spaces, and I’m not going to tolerate it.”

> I’m the first woman to graduate from the Citadel, the Military College of South Carolina. If some guy in a skirt came by and said, ‘No, that’s my achievement.’ I’m going to be there and standing in the way and saying, ‘Hell no.’ I’m not going to allow men to erase women or women’s rights.”

First of all, trans people statistically do not pose any risk to people in bathrooms and are instead far more at risk of being abused or harassed while trying to use facilities. Yet Republicans, and in typical fashion mind you, pretend like this issue is some widespread, inescapable epidemic.

Think about how ego centric this is too. They're the victims at the center of a trans agenda thats oppressing *them,* ""erasing their rights."" This isn't about the rights of trans persons, it's not even an effort to address which bathrooms should be reserved for the trans community, It's about *their* feelings, no one else's. It's about what kind of experience they're entitled to while using a public bathroom, and f*ck the feelings of the trans woman, this is about me me me.

Someone should ask Mace, or any Republican congressman for that matter, to identify any cases of trans people harassing someone in a public bathroom. And you know what, for the sake of argument, let's say they do identify a case, It still doesn't mean that one incident is broadly representative of how all trans persons behave.

What's particularly unnerving here is that Republicans like Mace just presume they will be tormented in public bathrooms by trans people, that they are under attack, that they are the victims here, when in reality, it's not only a presumption attempting to justify discriminatory policy, but it's people like McBride who are the actual victims of harassment in these scenarios.

So Mace and her fearmongering coalition of bigots ignore or outright dismiss the fact that it's trans individuals who are much more likely to be hassled in public bathrooms, while Republicans like Nancy are the actual enablers of that harassment, and they're basically resorting to a form of victim blaming.

These Republicans just suspect that trans people prioritize using bathrooms to make others feel uncomfortable, that whenever a trans individual uses a public bathroom, it's, first and foremost, for the purpose of provoking others. Instead of the fact that, you know, they're just there to do their own business, and mind their own business for that matter, just like most people who use the public restroom.

Republicans presume a whole lot about the LGBTQ community. And most of it is rooted in their own insecurities, their prejudices, their hate. So they pass laws to validate these feelings. If it's written into law, it becomes an official acknowledgement. If there's a law prohibiting Sarah McBride from using the women's bathroom, it must be for a reason. And now that reason becomes a reality for them.

While make no mistake, this is only one step away from Republican men refusing to share a bathroom with people like McBride. Which is one step away from either banning her from using public bathrooms altogether, or designating a bathroom strictly for people like McBride. You know, just like how bathrooms were segregated a century ago.

This is what Republicans do, they incessantly vilify out-groups, foreigners, gay and trans people, ""the other,"" so that they can create scapegoats and boogeymen. Then these scapegoats and boogeymen become the targets of their outrage, their hate, their blame, their grievances, their discrimination and ultimately, their legislative efforts. And all of these things are part of a kind of feedback loop.

Their fears, their hate, their hostility towards these groups, and the misinformation and propaganda they generate, help them justify the legislation they pass, and that legislation helps reinforce their fears and contempt for those groups even more, which then strengthens their case for more discriminatory and suppressive measures, and around and around it goes.",1732248600.0,lyd4bfq

"""Which means Smith now has fewer than seventy days to complete his work—including his final report. Under the [special counsel regulations](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/28/part-600), Smith is required to provide the attorney general, “at the conclusion of the Special Counsel’s work, . . . with a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions reached by the Special Counsel.” Garland must then “notify the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the Judiciary Committees of each House of Congress.”

Smith must decide whether to complete two separate reports covering the two distinct investigations or a single report encompassing both. Either way, just over two months is not a lot of time to assemble final reports covering such large investigations, so Smith’s team will need to work fast. Recall that Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report into Russian interference in the 2020 election and Trump’s efforts to obstruct that investigation spanned [nearly 450 pages](https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/18/politics/full-mueller-report-pdf/index.html). Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr’s report into the Whitewater investigation of the Clintons [stretched to 445 pages](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/clinton-impeachment/starr-submits-report-house/), and included 36 boxes of sealed grand jury material.



Will there be any surprises in what Smith writes? Although much of the story around January 6th has long been public—and the House January 6th Committee’s [final report](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-J6-REPORT/pdf/GPO-J6-REPORT.pdf) is impressively comprehensive—the scope of the damage to national security inflicted by Trump’s cavalier handling of classified information remains secret.

Which brings us to the question of whether Garland will publish Smith’s reports. The regulations say that it is exclusively up to the attorney general to determine whether “public release of these reports would be in the public interest.” Presumably, he will make large parts of the report public—as he did with Special Counsel [Robert Hur’s report](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/09/garland-decision-release-hur-report-00140806) regarding classified documents found at the home of the president who appointed him, Joe Biden, a move that triggered sharp critiques from the left.

Looming over Smith’s and Garland’s decisions is the specter of the ex-president who is now the incoming president. Trump has promised vengeance through his Justice Department, which he announced on Wednesday will be led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) as attorney general, if Trump gets his way.

Join

It’s worth keeping an eye on two categories of information that could be released in Smith’s final reports: classified information and grand jury records. Biden could declassify parts of the Mar-a-Lago records for no other reason than to preserve for posterity the facts regarding Trump’s alleged national security crimes. If the records of the investigation aren’t declassified and published before the change in administrations, Trump will undoubtedly order them all destroyed—an action that the Supreme Court’s ruling in *Trump v. U.S.* would insulate from scrutiny.

As for the grand jury material, which underlies both cases, it can only be released under [Rule 6 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/rule_6) if U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan in D.C. (possible) and U.S. Judge Aileen Cannon in Florida (impossible) sign off.

\==========================


Edit:  because I'm tired of these BS replies claiming he's antifa or a Democrat.

Here's the evidence we have right now:

His donation was $15 to a progressive voter turnout group on the day of Biden's inauguration (Jan 20, 2021) when he was 17. It was to one of those spam email donation links and could have been anything: a bet lost, a misunderstanding that the group was progressive and not general get out the vote, a legit donation, who knows?

[Donation](https://i.imgur.com/eF46TzP.jpeg)

[An article discussing the donation](https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/trumps-shooter-gave-15-to-a-progressive)

TLDR: spam donation, may have just confused him as a get out the vote thing.  He unsubscribed from them later.

Regardless, he registered Sept 28, 2021, 8 months later, as a Republican to vote in the 2022 midterms, which he did.  Note that he didn't register for the primary.  It was well before that.  We don't even have evidence he voted in the primary. This implies he didn't though (last vote date Nov 8, 2022).

[Registration](https://i.imgur.com/f6LNDXk.jpeg)

We also have accounts of his classmates saying he was deeply conservative. 

[Inquirer Article](https://www.inquirer.com/news/pennsylvania/thomas-matthew-crooks-trump-shooter-id-butler-20240714.html)

> Former student Max R. Smith remembered Crooks as an intelligent classmate with conservative political leanings. Smith recalled participating in a mock debate in a course they took together, where their teacher posed questions on government policy and had students stand on opposite sides of the classroom to signal their support or opposition.

> “The majority of the class were on the liberal side, but Tom, no matter what, always stood his ground on the conservative side,” Smith said. “That’s still the picture I have of him. Just standing alone on one side while the rest of the class was on the other. ... It makes me wonder why he would carry out an assassination attempt on the conservative candidate.”

">If you listened, though, there was some news here. Musk — who did a glitchy, podcast-style [interview](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/what-did-elon-musk-ask-donald-trump.html) with Trump where he bragged about firing employees — has apparently agreed to head a commission that would root out what Trump calls government fraud and abuse. Government waste, particularly in the form of fraudulent spending, is in fact a major problem in the budget, with the Government Accountability Office estimating that it reaches [more than $500 billion a year](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-105833#:~:text=We%20estimated%20that%20the%20federal,is%20required%20to%20address%20it.). (Trump’s plan is similar to the GAO’s Biden-era approach for rooting it out.) The Musk-led commission, if it ever happens, would supposedly save “trillions” of dollars over an unspecified period.

>Trump also pledged to cut ten regulations for every one that passes — a five-fold increase from a 2016 pledge. He also cycled through a few promises that he’s made in the past, such as cutting taxes for Social Security benefits and corporate research and development, increasing oil drilling in the U.S., and, maybe, [locking up Harris](https://x.com/atrupar/status/1831736453484662948). Hard to tell if he was actually serious about that last one or if he was just trying to get his audience to wake up.

So the policies are: 

(1) Put Musk in charge of a Trump version of the Government Accountability Office

(2) Attack regulations that protect workers, consumers, and the environment

(3) Cut taxes (i.e., cut programs that rely on those taxes) on Social Security and Corporate R&D

(4) Increase the amount of oil and gas leases (in the hopes that it will bring down energy costs \[note: it won't\])

(5) Weaponize the Justice Department against political enemies

"A bit from the commentary:

> the court's corruption is deeply intertwined with the bad decisions that are inflicting harm on millions of people. This is why I was pleased to see Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. file articles of impeachment against Thomas and Alito this week, accusing them of ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" for hiding the millions of dollars of gifts received from billionaires. She's also charged them for not recusing from election-related cases, despite substantial evidence that they and their wives have insurrectionist sympathies. Despite her strong social media presence and lefty credentials, Ocasio-Cortez has earned a reputation as a serious leader and not one prone to cheap political stunts. She wouldn't be doing this if she weren't serious, even though she fully admits it will go nowhere in a GOP-dominated House. 
> 
> It's also a big deal, because Ocasio-Cortez is known for being a nuts-and-bolts politician. While she is conversant in more abstract topics, she's celebrated for her skill at explaining, in an accessible way, how economic and health care policy impacts people's lives. She has been one of the most effective elected officials speaking out against Dobbs, for instance. This is precisely why she's the perfect person to take the lead in keeping the corruption story alive. She's well-positioned to explain how elite corruption is a big reason why the Supreme Court keeps issuing dangerous opinions that hurt ordinary people.
> 
> In her speech introducing the articles, Ocasio-Cortez drew a direct line between the corruption of Thomas and Alito and ""the suffering of the American people."" She argued that we cannot ""pretend that this corruption is wholly unrelated to the pregnant Americans now suffering and bleeding out in emergency rooms"" because of the Dobbs decision penned by Alito.

">The Florida Department of Education (FLDOE) has ordered local school districts to submit their sex education plans to the state for approval. The FLDOE has also said the classes must promote abstinence and cannot include discussion of contraception or pictures of reproductive health organs.

>For some time, Florida law has mandated that sex-ed lessons emphasize the “benefits of sexual abstinence as the expected standard and the consequences of teenage pregnancy” for grades 6 through 12.

>But now the state has removed any local control of additional information school districts can provide their students.

>“Pictures of external sexual/reproductive anatomy should not be included in any grade level,” the memo recorded state officials as saying. “Contraceptives are not part of any health or science standard” but could be mentioned as a “health resource,” though “pictures, activities, or demonstrations that illustrate their use should not be included in instruction in any grade level,” it said.

>Now the state must approve any additional curriculum and they’ll either deny the additions or ignore them, forcing local districts to cancel sex-ed classes altogether until the state addresses their plans.

>Elissa Barr, a professor of public health at the University of North Florida and a member of the sex ed advocacy group Florida Healthy Youth Alliance, has been keeping in touch with local school officials and compiling a list of words and phrases they’ve been told to remove from their reproductive health plans.

>These words include abuse, consent, domestic violence, fluids, gender identity and LGBTQ information, she said.

>Removing the word “fluids” from lessons will make it hard to teach about how HIV is transmitted, for instance, since it spreads through blood, breast milk, semen and vaginal “fluids”.

>“That’s science,” Barr said.

The issue is with people who don’t closely follow politics. Most people have no idea what is going on in the world, don’t understand basic politics or basic policy.

No. But that’s too bad, our monkey brains like leaders who appear confident, and for the average undecided voter that’s mostly what matters to them. 

We can possibly win with Biden, nothing is set in stone. But everyone thinks he is too old for the job and he acts like he is. He does not give the Democratic Party the best chance of beating the republicans.

"“According to new court filings, Representative Matt Gaetz attended a sex party with a 17-year-old girl.

The court filings contain sealed affidavits from three eyewitness testimonies that the party was held at the Florida home of lobbyist Chris Dorworth, who is also a friend of Gaetz, NOTUS reported Friday. The filings were part of a civil lawsuit brought by Dorworth in 2023. Dorworth ultimately dropped the lawsuit, but Dorworth’s attorneys filed the documents in federal court to try and recoup legal fees.

One of the witnesses said in a sworn affidavit that the teenager, who was a junior in high school at the time, was naked; people attending the party engaged in “sexual activities”; and partygoers consumed alcohol, cocaine, ecstasy, and marijuana. Testimony from the witness and two other women, one of whom was Gaetz’s then girlfriend, all placed the congressman at the party. A digital forensic examiner also confirmed activity from Gaetz’s cell phone at Dorworth’s house.

This is the first time that “sworn testimony has been referenced in public court filings alleging that the congressman attended one of the long-rumored parties tied to an alleged underage sex scandal,” according to NOTUS. Previous details regarding Gaetz’s involvement, such as reported Venmo transactions of Gaetz allegedly paying his friend Joel Greenberg to arrange sex with young women, have not been made public. Greenberg was convicted of several charges, including fraud and sex trafficking, in 2021, and is currently serving an 11-year prison sentence.

Gaetz is currently facing a House Ethics Committee investigation into his alleged activities, and a woman has already come forward alleging that he paid her for sex. A previous Justice Department investigation resulted in Gaetz escaping federal charges, although Greenberg was convicted after a plea deal.”",1726866762.0,lo43qwi

The Trump campaign told ProPublica the increase was due to Epshteyn’s workload increasing, even though Epshteyn has continued taking contracts for other campaigns and landed a job as a managing director at a financial securities firm elsewhere.

>Susie Wiles, senior adviser to Trump’s 2024 campaign who allegedly witnessed Trump showing off classified documents, also saw a big bump in pay after being called to a grand jury and before Trump’s indictment in that case. Her pay jumped from $25,000 a month to $30,000 a month and her consulting firm received a hefty $75,000, according to ProPublica. Team Trump claims payments to the consulting firm were simply backpay and her raise was because she “redid her contract.” Her daughter Caroline was hired by the Trump campaign a few months later, receiving a salary of $222,000 and becoming the fourth-highest-paid campaign staffer. Caroline told ProPublica she got the job “because I earned it,” telling ProPublica, “I don’t think it has anything to do with Susie,” referring to her mother. Meanwhile, her mother stated she directly hired her nepobaby daughter and that Trump had no influence in that decision.

"***Exclusive From Rolling Stone’s Asawin Suebsaeng and Andrew Perez:***

As he entered the final stretch of the 2024 presidential race, Donald Trump spent much of this month trying to disown the highly Trumpy, Heritage Foundation-led Project 2025 — to the point that he even got his fans to boo the initiative during a recent campaign rally. His protracted freakout over the conservative project — to which he has multiple direct ties, and which is only as extreme as it is largely because of his influence — is driven almost entirely by Trump’s fear over one thing.

When the twice-impeached ex-president and convicted felon took to social media in early July to make the (patently absurd) claim that “I know nothing about Project 2025 \[and\] I have no idea who is behind it,” he added, “I disagree with some of the things they’re saying and some of the things they’re saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal.” He did not specify what “things” he meant.

But according to two sources with direct knowledge of the matter, shortly before he posted that brief message, Trump had been privately — and very bitterly — complaining about the abortion policies laid out in the lengthy Project 2025 manifesto, and trashing the Project 2025-linked “lunatics” who keep demanding unpopular abortion bans and restrictions. Among the policy proposals in Project 2025’s policy roadmap are plans to end federal approval for abortion pills, use federal agencies for expanded “abortion surveillance,” restrict access to emergency contraception, end the federal requirement that hospitals provide medically necessary emergency abortion care, and revive a 150-year-old law that could serve as a de facto national abortion ban.

For what it’s worth, some of the people who helped author Project 2025’s abortion provisions were appointed under Trump to influential federal posts during his first stint in the White House — including Roger Severino, who headed the HHS’ Office of Civil Rights under Trump, and Gene Hamilton, who worked in Trump’s Justice Department and Homeland Security Department.

"The norms we enjoy are established with assumptions:

\- The SCOTUS does not interpret the constitution in a way that is contradictory against the constitution. There is nothing within the constitution that prevents the SCOTUS from essentially nullifying parts of the constitution. If the SCOTUS decides to interpret that the 1st amendment doesn't actually give you freedom of speech, you no longer have freedom of speech. There is no check against a SCOTUS that works to undermine the constitution directly.

\- The POTUS cares what the SCOTUS says. The Executive Branch is the enforcement arm of the USA. The enforcement arm has gone rogue before. “The decision of the supreme court has fell still born, and they find that it cannot coerce Georgia to yield to its mandate.” - Andrew Jackson. The built in check against a rogue POTUS is technically impeachment, but that's never happened. It's unlikely that the GOP would impeach a POTUS that blatantly ignores the constitution if that POTUS is also a member of the GOP.

So, while it's nice and all that the constitution directly contradicts a lot of the promises Trump is making, we've seen that the GOP does not care about the constitution. Texas, as an example, has overstepped their authority on the border and *nothing* was done about it. The concern therefore isn't whether or not the constitution protects birthright citizenship, but rather how far the GOP, controlling all three branches of government, would go to erode the constitution in order to go on their xenophobic crusade to attack non-Americans.

Hopefully all goes well and either Trump is blowing out his ass or the GOP has no inclination to subvert the constitution for Trump to adhere to his campaign promises. However, it's wise to be prepared for the worst possible scenario.",1733925625.0,m1iw3wv

Justice system: ""Wrong! Again, YOU can't try to overthrow the government, but Trump can, we will allow it.""

Why do we think this will be different?  Trump will do what he wants, people will clutch their pearls, and the justice system will say ""well... our reading of the law states that while birthright citizenship is a legal, constitutional right, now that Trump wants it gone, it's NOT a right anymore based on this incoherent interpretation of a bunch of other nonsense that we just made.""

"I am not American, but I have been paying a lot of attention to American politics at least since 2012. This one is unlike anything else. Even January 6th wasn't really that shoking to me, even though it was pretty much a coup attempt. Emotionally, it just didn't hit me. It was so pathetic and crude, just a bunch of delusional idiots rioting, led by their head idiot Trump. But this decision is something else. The Supreme Court is supposed to be official, proper, prestigious, with careful, ponderous, fair and wise people who make important decisions based on sound arguments. At least since the Trump presidency, it has been the complete opposite of any of that, although we can look back at for example the Bush vs Gore decision to know that it has been terrible for a long time.

As long as this ruling by the Supreme Court stands, I will not consider USA to be a democratic or free.

Even if Democrats win big this year and somehow miraculously stay in power long enough for enough of the 6 corrupt supreme court justices to retire, and be replaced by better judges who overturn this decision, that still leaves it for all clear as day: All you need is to control the supreme court, and you can declare yourself a dictator. And if you're on the court, you don't suffer any punishment for blatant corruption or for almost literally trying to crown an absolute monarch despite this being in direct contradiction to the constitution that you're supposed to be basing your judgements on.

There is no outcome here where everything just goes back to ""normal"". The Supreme Court cannot exist in this form without being a ticking time bomb. It needs to be reformed.

I don't know what Americans are going to do about this. The options or possible outcomes seem as following:

1. Biden uses the power handed to him to make fundamental reforms to the Supreme Court, likely including the removal of the 5 corrupt justices in whatever way he can. Honestly, I am hoping something like this, because this would be the fastest and most effective way, and it would be 100% justified, but this seems unlikely given Biden's tendencies and the whole ""taking the high road"" approach that Democrats seem to obsess over. It could also backfire even if he did do it.
2. Democrats somehow win enough seats to impeach the justices and reform the Supreme court. This is possible, but if 8 years of knowing Donald Trump hasn't eroded support for him, I don't know why this decision would do that, and hand Democrats a super-majority in the Senate, House etc. Also reforming the court would probably require an amendment that requires enough states to sign up, an even more impossible task.
3. Some sort of popular revolution forces through a change. But again, if you cannot even get Democrats elected, how are you going to get enough support for a revolution? This also means a lot of instability, conflict, political violence, even outright civil war.
4. Nothing is done, and eventually USA simply stops (""gradually, then suddenly"") being a democratic country. People's lives might continue in some ways fairly normally, just as they do in, say, Russia. But just as in Russia, your rights can and will get taken away on a whim, your elections will be fake, your leaders will be corrupt, and in general, all human progress in USA will be massively hindered by corruption, suppression of human rights, arbitrary rule, and so on. Meanwhile, chronic long-term problems like climate change, environmental destruction, resource shortages, demographic crises etc. will keep getting worse, and for example the large majority of the nuclear weapons of the world will be in the hands of dictators.

I hope I am exaggerating, but this might be the end of USA as we know it if nothing dramatically changes for the better. If this goes on, no country can rely on USA any more. I think the EU will have to massively change its general approach to things like foreign policy and security (though the war in Ukraine is already forcing a lot of that). My personal choice would be a transformation towards a more federal EU, but the actual change remains to be seen. In any case, the EU and its member states have their own problems with the far-right, so this is by no means a case of Europeans somehow being better than Americans. USA's downfall is not something for Europeans to mock or feel smug or superior about, it is a grave warning of what might happen to us too.

Any person that supports Trump, that supports any Republicans who support Trump or these justices, they have betrayed USA, the Western world, the whole of human civilization. They have betrayed freedom, democracy, and reason, and shat on hard-fought human ideals that have been developed over centuries in the pursuit of establishing fairness, justice, and better and happier human lives.

# Musk Repeatedly Promoted ""Conservative"" Outlet That Was Secretly Being Funded by Moscow, According to DOJ Indictment

Elon Musk, currently the world's richest person, repeatedly used his influential X platform — which he bought as Twitter in 2022 — to promote posts from a right-wing media company that was allegedly peddling Russian propaganda in exchange for cash from Moscow.  
  
The Department of Justice (DOJ) dropped a bombshell indictment yesterday alleging that the Russian state-owned media organization RT secretly funneled about $10 million into a Tennessee-based media network that produced videos for and paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to several right-wing social media influencers with massive digital footprints. The indictment didn't name the American company at the heart of the covert influence campaign, but as multiple outlets have reported, details make it obvious they're talking about a venture called Tenet Media.  
  
And Musk, who has spiraled deeply into conspiratorial, red-pilled far-right politics, has repeatedly engaged with and boosted content published directly by Tenet Media — not to mention countless posts created and published by the influencers who were cashing Tenet paychecks.

"Donald Trump has literally been indicted for ""defrauding The United States,"" but both him and his followers praise him as an honest-to-God man, while they attack Kamala Harris for being ""fake.""

He's been indicted for conspiring to overturn the last election, for trying to install loyalists into positions of power within the DOJ, to help *him* steal the election, but him and his supporters claim that *Democrats* stole the election.

He's been indicted for attempting to intimidate state election officials into manipulating the vote for him, he's repeatedly refused to acknowledge how Russian election meddling helped him win his first election, but Trump and his supporters claim that it's his opponents who are interfering in elections.

He's been involved in over 4,000 legal cases, many of which include financial crimes, tax and state law violations, corrupt business practices, multi million dollar disputes and defamation cases. He used his power as president to enrich himself. He has a penchant for obstructing justice. He was convicted of felony fraud and was court ordered to payout millions for misusing charitable funds for political purposes... *Takes a breather*

Trump management was sued by the DOJ for violating the fair housing act and discriminating against black renters. He's the first president to become a convicted felon, and was recently found guilty of falsifying business records to conceal a crime. He was ordered to pay tens of millions of dollars to victims of his Trump University scheme. 

He's been indicted for obstructing the governments efforts to retrieve classified documents scattered all over his Mar-A-Lago residence, and on multiple occasions that we know of, showed those classified materials to people not authorized to view them, all while lying to the DOJ and National Archives for over a year in order to impede their efforts to retrieve those materials.

He also suggested shooting peaceful demonstrators so he could get a proper photo op in front of a church...

This list goes on and on, but for the sake of not running into reddit's character limit I'll say that despite all this, Trump and his supporters praise him as the ""Law & Order"" candidate while they incessantly accuse his opponents of being corrupt criminals.

Trump also uses Law & Order rhetoric on the campaign trail to promote racist dog whistles in the same way conservatives like George Wallace, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan did back in the 60's and 70s. 

Trump has remarked on a number of occasions that he intends to consolidate power if he wins the next election, and put most government agencies under his direct control, including the DOJ, so he can satisfy his lust for vengeance and jail, not investigate, but jail all of his political adversaries. 

Trump has used his power, wealth and privilege throughout his entire life and political career to game the justice system and avoid being incriminated. He equates accountability with persecution, and he constantly suggests that he'll disregard the constitution and go after all his critics in the media if he's put back in the Whitehouse. 

On more than one occasion, Trump has evaded justice by power of executive privilege and through broad immunities granted to him by a Supreme Court that he packed with kowtowing loyalists. Trump has also been accused of obstructing justice on over a dozen occasions.

And again, despite all of this, Trump and his supporters claim that it's Democrats who have ""weaponized the justice system"" against Trump.

Trump has been accused of sexual abuse, harassment, and rape by dozens of women, one of whom is his ex-wife. He's been held liable for sexual assault in civil court, while he's responsible for a rise in misogyny and LGBTQ discrimination among many of his young male supporters. Yet it's Democrats (and immigrants) who are the ""rapists.""

Donald Trump has been caught in so many lies that fact checking him is a full-time job, and at this point, there's no way of counting just how many lies or misleading statements he's shared.

Trump promoted one of the most dangerous lies in recent political history when he claimed that the 2020 election would be ""stolen"" from him months leading up to the election and since thereafter. 

His lies and his incendiary rhetoric facilitated January 6th. His constant soapboxing and demagoguery, his use of inflammatory speech, his incessant promotion of conspiracy theories, misinformation and propaganda, and his antagonistic, fearmongering, sensational rhetoric has catered to extremists and has incited political violence.

Donald Trump is more responsible than any other political figure for inflaming America's culture wars.

His appeal to far right and white supremacist groups has directly led to an increase in domestic terrorist activities in this country. He is personally responsible for dividing and polarizing Americans to such an extreme, that civil unrest is more of a threat to our democracy than it's been in centuries. He has inspired a hate-fueled, fanatical movement of ultra nationalists and nativists whose xenophobic, bigoted, hostile attitudes have become normalized.

Yet again, despite all of this, it's *Democrats* who are the liars, who are solely responsible for provoking violence, hate and fear...

"1) None of the potential candidates want to be seen or be known as dishonourable backstabbers (by their own party and by biden supporting dems and swing voterx)

2) if they run now and lose, they torpedo their chances of ever being the 2028 democrat nominee because they will be known as the person who lost to Trump, regardless of circumstances
2a) If a democrat candidate other than biden wins, all of the other candidates would have to wait 8 years to have a chance to become the democrat nominee in 2032, while for biden they would only have to wait 4 years until 2028 (thanks to the person who pointed this out)

3) If they speak out against biden or call for his resignation and biden wins, He will remember their disloyalty, and they would torpedo their chances of ever getting a cabinet position. (Mayor Pete is transport minister) 

4) no one knows how the voting public would react to a new candidate. polling numbers tell one thing, but those candidates aren't nominee yet.



5) Any replacement other than Harris has a good chance of splitting the party between the progressive and neoliberals, causing some to stay home.

6) Harris is not popular, lacks chrisamia, and she's a black woman. Do not underestimate how racist and sexist America is,and it could turn some swing voters off from voting or they could vote for trump just to keep a black woman away from the white house.

6) The $250 million in campaign money can't be used by any replacement other than Harris unless Biden plays ball (and every sign points to that not happening) All that money will have to be refunded and there's a good chance they won't bother donating again

7) Republicans will challenge any replacement (other than harris) in court, they said they would do it and it would be a massive headache to deal with (Republicans control SCOTUS as well so the dems will certainly lose any legal fight) in the lower courts, espeically in the 5th circuit where this kind of lawsuit is likely to be filed could issue a preliminary injunction against nominating any candidate other than harris and the DNC wouldn't want to risk being charged with contempt of court.

8) it will cost a ton of money to replace campaign infrastructure (billboards, signs, t shirts, ad buys, volunteers) and a massive and hugely expensive media campaign (and a unprecedented grassroots movement) would be needed to give the candidate the needed name recognition and even then it might not be enough to inform the voters enough to win

9) Biden has personally met with and spoken to a lot of voters at rallies, people remember what biden did for them policy wise, especially with student loan debt relief, and eliminating junk fees. He has inspired a lot of loyalty with voters which a replacement won't have.

10) If they choose to sideline Harris a lot of POC Democrat voters would be enraged that a black woman is being sidelined by a white man like Newsom or even someone like Whitmer. it could enrage them enough to stay home come election night. 

Biden (who is showing signs of decline) is still the strongest candidate. Unfortunately, the DNC should've held an open convention and planned for his replacement months ago,

EDIT: to everyone saying that Obama got in even though he was black 

1)America was a lot less extremist, partisan, and openly racist back in 2008 and 2012 (trump's antics, open bigotry, and dog whistle racism would've been career ending for any other politician back then)

Tell me about how anyone else back in 2008 or 2012 could've gotten away with saying ""illegal immigrants are taking black jobs"" on a live presidential debate back then and still have people voting and cheering for him afterwards.

Over the next four years though, the effect of his leadership chaos and its fallout led to the total, embarrassing and chaotic collapse of the modern Tory party, despite a frankly low-grade showing for over a decade by Labour in opposition.

I'm not predicting anything as predictions are difficult, especially regarding the future, and I'm not saying it'll be harmless because god knows the Tories made a mess before they fucked off... But this might be the beginnings of the collapse of this version of the Republicans.

"* Student: I want to become a teacher to help kids, but I don't think it's possible with the low pay teachers get.

* Republican government: We've created a program called Public Service Loan Forgiveness to incentivize people who go into public service roles. If you make 10 years of payments, your remaining balance will be forgiven.

* Student: Hmm... okay, I think I can make it work then. As long as I can survive the first 10 years of payments, it's worth pursuing my dream of becoming a teacher.

*10+ years later*

* Student: Yay, after dilegently making payments for 10 years, my loans should be forgiven now right?

* Government under Trump: Naw

* Student: But... that was the contract. That's what was promised to me through President Bush's PSLF program.

* Government under Trump: Don't care!

*Biden enters office*

* Biden administration: Okay, we're going to start forgiving loans of public service workers who have fulfilled their end of the bargain.

* Conservative voters: WHAT?!?!? THAT'S UNFAIR!!! BIDEN IS BUYING VOTES!!! WHY NOT ERASE MY CREDIT CARD DEBT?

* Fox News: This is OUTRAGEOUS. Who will pay for this? The American taxpayer - that's who. Biden is just buying votes to pander to the left!

"*From Bloomberg News reporter Akayla Gardner:* 

President Joe Biden canceled an additional $1.2 billion in student debt for public servants on Thursday, the latest effort to provide loan relief and deliver on one of his signature initiatives in the midst of a reelection campaign.

The assistance will affect 35,000 public service workers enrolled in the government’s loan forgiveness program, including nurses, firefighters and teachers. The individuals received waivers or were affected by regulatory changes that gave them more credit toward the system’s decade-long payment requirement.

“They will now have more breathing room to support themselves and their families,” Biden said in a statement.",1721298576.0,ldr1vb3

This is a special hate because it’s not borne out of sporadic emotion, but built into their newly formed identity. It’s a trait that was easy to teach because all you need is (1) a relatively politically uninformed group of people who are collectively indignant, and (2) a simple and identifiable scapegoat, and (3) a “simple” solution to punish the scapegoat.

The Pavlovian conditioning response comes from (3) and is, importantly, why I quoted the word simple: The people can easily understand a short, simple, loud, blanket solution to a complex problem that said people poorly understand. A lightning bulb moment: they *understand* now. They feel smart. They like it. And they want more. And Trump scratches that itch.

Deport illegals. Ban abortion. Impose tariffs. Easy peasy. No consequences.

I believe this election is the start of a long uphill battle against identify politics fueled by hate.

If Harris is even, slightly ahead, or slightly behind, in these 4 states her more established and larger leads in the Blue Wall states of PA, WI and MI are no surprise.

We know this, Trump knows this, he has been recorded saying that he knows he shouldn't have them, and he went out of his way to try and hide them from the FBI.

Of course, if he declassified them, that's a different story. But he didn't. We know he didn't. He knows he didn't. And yet again, *he has been recorded saying that he never declassified them*. (**EDIT: As has been established by the over 50 notifications this comment got me, declassification is actually entirely irrelevant to the discussion.

Biden couldn't compete on that ground, so Trump was ok. Harris finally did what was necessary and brought the force of personality to burst that bubble and show that he can dominated by someone they desperately need to feel is inferior to Trump and by extension, them.

"For decades, Pulitzer-winning journalist David Cay Johnston  reported on Donald Trump's long-standing ties to Russia, beginning in the late 1980s. Which findings have since been corroborated  by many other reputable sources, including the wrongfully and maliciously maligned Mueller report.

Johnston’s key findings include:

* **Compromising Information**: Russia has reportedly accumulated 30 years' worth of damaging information on Trump, linked to his questionable business dealings and connections with Russian oligarchs and gangsters.
* **Early Entanglements**: Donald Trump Jr. has admitted to receiving significant funds from Russians, and Johnston notes Trump's involvement with Russian criminals from the late 1980s.
* **Manipulation and Blackmail**: Johnston suggests that Trump's narcissism has made him susceptible to manipulation and blackmail by Putin and Russian intelligence.
* **Extensive Business Dealings**: In his book, “The Making of Donald Trump,” Johnston outlines Trump’s extensive interactions with Russian mobsters and oligarchs, alongside Trump's consistent denials of any misconduct, which Johnston attributes to his “con artist” tendencies.

Based on this information - much of which has been publicly available for decades - Trump should have been disqualified as a candidate back in 2015. And Trump isn't a legitimate candidate **NOW** for the very same reasons of his remaining a national security risk as well as a result of his insurrection attempts in 2020-21.

No question - whatsoever - in my mind that Trump has already shared highly classified national security secrets with Putin during his time in office as well as shared the trove of highly classified documents he's stolen from the U.S. gov't when he left office.

An act which Trump insists that  Pres. Biden be charged and arrested for (on baseless charges) but **NOT** him, for which there exists mountains of concrete, credible evidence of wrongdoing. Trump's narcissistic double-standard hypocrisy is just mind-numbing.

There is ***ONLY ONE*** place  Traitor Trump belongs in at this moment - and that is in prison - preferably Guantanamo.",1728585458.0,lraijhe

>Top American counterintelligence officials warned every C.I.A. station and base around the world last week about troubling numbers of informants recruited from other countries to spy for the United States being captured or killed, people familiar with the matter said.

>The message, in an unusual top secret cable, said that the C.I.A.’s counterintelligence mission center had looked at dozens of cases in the last several years involving foreign informants who had been killed, arrested or most likely compromised. Although brief, the cable laid out the specific number of agents executed by rival intelligence agencies — a closely held detail that counterintelligence officials typically do not share in such cables.

>The cable highlighted the struggle the spy agency is having as it works to recruit spies around the world in difficult operating environments. **In recent years, adversarial intelligence services in countries such as Russia, China, Iran and Pakistan have been hunting down the C.I.A.’s sources** and in some cases turning them into double agents.
