The page was kind of like a local events/news page that has a strong youth demographic, which I thought would look good on my portfolio when it comes to interviews and being asked for experience (experience is cruical here). She would call herself a startup since she claimed to generate revenue via paid sponsorships at events and on her page, claimed to own a marketing company (never gave me details on, dont even know if its true), she gave me bullshit about hiring more interns to create more content (which she never did, and then walked back on when we asked about it multiple times), gave me bullshit on hiring people to create a website (which still hasn\'t been created).
