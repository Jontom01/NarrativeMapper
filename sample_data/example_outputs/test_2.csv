The obligation of an employer is to maintain accurate timekeeping for every employee. How they do this isn't regulated, but the information required is. (hours worked per day, clock in/out times, breaks, paid wages, etc.) This means they don't have to use a time clock, but if they do, they must still report accurate hours for the employee with that system.\n\nIn the OP's case they have a malfunctioning time clock system. That's an employer problem, not an employee one, but the employer is threatening not to pay employees for hours \\*they should know the employee is working.\\* If this came up in litigation or a labor dispute at a state/local level, the employer would be on the hook to show that the employee did not work using the \\*accurate hours they are required by law to keep.\\*\n\nThe first response to that requirement would be the (correct) statement that their time clock system is not functioning properly and therefore they are not keeping accurate records. In several states (California/NY/et al) the lack of accurate employer records alone is sufficient basis to rely solely on employee verbal claims for damages, since it is not the employees job to keep  the accurate records. In other states a simple written record kept by the employee with dates/times is sufficient.\n\nAlso - you people trying to defend the employer need to knock it off. Their job is to maintain accurate records and they are failing to do so. Getting upset because I don't tolerate nonsense from employers doesn't make me upset it just makes you look like a weirdo.  \n\n\nPrevious:\n\nSo this is an interesting scenario where its actually fairly cut and dry how its handled. Employers are responsible for accurately reporting hours, full stop. It doesn't matter if an employee time clock doesn't work, or they forget to report, or what have you. \\*Accurately\\* reporting that time (and taxes etc) is the sole responsibility of the employer.\n\nThey can punish employees for failing to report hours, even fire them, but they cannot simply assume you are not at work when they should reasonably know otherwise. That is fraud, and is a crime. The correct action in scenarios where employee hours are uncertain is to pay tentative or estimated hours as usual for the pay period and verify after the fact. (e.g. if they normally work 40 hours/week, pay them the 40 hours and adjust any difference on the next paycheck)\n\nYou can read more about that sort of thing below, but basically, if an employer knows (or should know) about work being done, they must accurately account for and pay for it.\n\n[https://www.employmentlawletter.com/2023/09/what-employers-should-do-when-employees-fail-to-report-time/](https://www.employmentlawletter.com/2023/09/what-employers-should-do-when-employees-fail-to-report-time/)"", ""If I was a CEO, I'd be asking what the F#@k they were doing in the call from the hospital.
