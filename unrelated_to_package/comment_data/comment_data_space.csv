"I remember Cassini launched when I was in middle school. There were worries about the safety of the launch because it carried 28 kilograms of plutonium in its radioisotope thermoelectric generator. 

I was in college when Cassini finally reached Saturn. NASA would post the raw image data on its website as it came in and I would rummage through it from time to time. It was fun seeing a new view of some moon like Enceladus, or the polar hexagon, or the rings. Hyperion looks like something you'd find washed up on a beach.

Cassini dropped the Huygens lander onto the mysterious, blurry and greasy moon Titan, the first landing on a moon that isn't Earth's. Videos were made of the whole descent. Cassini peered through the clouds and showed us the hydrocarbon rivers and lakes of this cold world. 

Eventually the mission came to an end and Cassini used its last bit of fuel to repeatedly dive through Saturn's rings and then burn up in its atmosphere, transmitting scientific data the whole time.

While it is true that the vast majority of hydrogen comes from the Big bang there are sources of hydrogen such as through the decay of neutrons. A neutron decays into a proton when it is no longer contained in a nucleus. Likewise although the vast majority of helium in the universe is made from the fusion of hydrogen virtually none of the helium on Earth was made that way. Helium on Earth is also the result of radioactive decay of alpha particles. The alpha particles are essentially just helium nuclei. They pick up a electron from the environment and that is how we have helium. The helium in the far upper atmosphere is helium that has escaped from the soil.,kxo3vai,space,1712045608.0

"Coordinated Lunar Time is abbreviated LTC, and not CLT, similar to how Coordinated Universal Time is UTC, and not CUT.

In the case of UTC, ""the decision to use ""UTC"" rather than ""CUT"" was made to avoid potential confusion with another existing time standard, known as ""Central Universal Time,"" which had been proposed earlier. Additionally, the choice of ""UTC"" also avoids favoring any particular language, as ""Coordinated Universal Time"" is an English translation of the French ""Temps Universel Coordonn√© (TUC),"" which itself was a compromise between English and French-speaking nations.""

Regarding LTC, ""The term ""Coordinated Lunar Time"" (CLT) isn't a widely recognized or established concept in the same way that Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is. The rationale for using ""LTC"" instead of ""CLT"" *would likely* follow similar principles as those for choosing ""UTC"" over ""CUT.""

An ant doesn‚Äôt know a tree is alive, as they live and die many generations upon the tree. Possibly us humans may not be aware of all levels of consciousness, we may simple think we live upon a floating rock, but there are signs life coming from this rock. 

I always thought of trees as possibly conscious, only measured over an accelerated time line. We humans see life in 32 frames per second. But what if trees see in one frame a month, or year. Their perception of life would be seeing us like flies, moving so fast, never really going anywhere. 

And if that were true, would then planets see life at an even slower frame rate?

 I always wondered if we were actually aware of other dimensions, with out realizing it,  two that I can think of are:

Time, as seen in different frames rates would allow multiple beings to live together without knowing others exist.

I mean, when (and if!) the big bang occurred the speed of it had to have drastically slowed down in speed during the first few nanoseconds or seconds the big bang occurred, right?

"Correction on your original description. Supernovas are not created by sun mass stars. They are created by stars at least 1.4 solar masses or more. That is called the Chandrasekar limit, and is the mass at which the core of the star crushes itself into a much smaller sphere of neutrons only a few kilometers across. This collapse releases an absolute buttload of energy that creates a shockwave, blowing the star up. 

Stars below this mass limit will go out with more of a fizzle, simply slowly gradually ejecting their outer layers in a planetary nebula leaving a white dwarf which is still insanely dense, but is more along the lines of the scale of a planet instead of a city and depending on the mass of the original star can be made of anything from super dense helium plasma to a mix of helium, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sometimes even neon.",l7wbyu0,space,1717981645.0

"Great Picture!

For anyone curious, this galaxy is NGC 4151 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_4151

It hosts the closest AGN to the Milky Way. An AGN is an Active Galactic Nucleus, and it refers to an actively ""feeding"" supermassive black hole at the center of its galaxy. Galaxies with nuclei that are active are, in general, younger galaxies. One of the fun things about AGN is that you can measure how the brightness of the core of the AGN changes, and then a few days later, you see the same variation in some of the spectral line emissions. This means there's a gas cloud there, but it also means you can measure the size of the gas cloud, and because of it orbits the central supermassive black hole, that size gives you a really good estimation of the mass of the black hole. This method (called reverberation mapping) is one of the best ways to get the mass of galactic nuclei.",l1scenq,space,1714399144.0

"There's in interesting 25 minute video on You tube that proposes that earth might have the only intelligent life in the galaxy  and possibly the only one in the whole universe.  It is very interesting if only for the arguments he makes.  One of them is that life itself may be common but intelligent life, not so much because life evolved very quickly after the earth cooled but intelligent life came in only the last few seconds on the cosmic scale AND the maximum lifespan of earth is already getting relatively close (he points out that life will end long before our sun goes totally red giant; that the early processes of solar expansion will create tidal waves that will end life on the planet.  

I, also, think of all the single points of failure that exist and the huge odds that crop up with only a modest number of them.  Think of each one as a particular card in a deck of 52 cards.  52 factorial is 

# 8.06581752 x 10^67 a HUGE number.  If there are at least 52 points of failure then that's the odds of intelligent live existing somewhere else.  The odds that a shuffle of the deck will produce exactly the same order of cards.

The possible single points of failure might include:

Magnetic field

Moon and tides

monkeys (never happened in North Americas)

Drying planet causing apes to migrate to savannahs

rise of mammals after mass extinction event

plate tectonics

"This is a great illustration of how much work there is left to go with space trash (both as a danger to operational spacecraft and as a problem for folks on the surface of the Earth). Everyone litters, absolutely everyone who is operating in space is littering in space. Some of it is small-ish, some of it is larger, some of it is huge. Every launch provider is leaving spent stages in orbit (for geostationary transfer orbit launches, for example). Every operator is leaving satellites in orbit even after they become inoperable. And everyone is leaving things to experience uncontrolled re-entry and burnup.

Many folks are putting in *some* work to mitigate these problems, it's not that everyone is universally just a bad actor in this space. Geostationary satellites are put into ""graveyard orbits"" before they run out of propellant so they don't interfere with active satellites, for example. Some spacecraft are intentionally de-orbited in a controlled manner at the end of their life to avoid endangering those on the ground. Many upper stages are also intentionally de-orbited safely when that is feasible (such as with LEO launches), and generally all upper stages are ""passivated"" to avoid excess debris creation from things like exploding propellant tanks.

But there's still a lot more that can be done. And there are some folks, like China, who are taking a regressive attitude toward space debris and moving the trends in the wrong direction.",kxqmmgw,space,1712084269.0
