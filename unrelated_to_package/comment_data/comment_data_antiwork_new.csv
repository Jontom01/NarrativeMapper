"You almost literally cannot become rich from working. It's never been possible to be rich from work alone. The only exceptions are incredibly famous talents. 

Look at anyone who has become rich. Even the traditional, self made millionaire, retired on a teacher's salary. Good for you. How'd you do it? Investing what I made working into a 401k and a home that appreciated in value. Perfect. So your wealth came from ownership, not work. You own a house and a tiny fraction of every public company. 

What about the small business owner who built a welding business from the ground up. The only employee there for the first 5 years until it grew. He's worth $10m now. Sure that's hard work. Commendable hustle. I have no problems with this. But you take out his ownership element of the business and he's broke. Imagine he'd been hired as a general manager to build up this business doing all the same work but the initial investment of capital he couldn't afford so it's someone else's business. They are now worth $10m and he is broke unless he achieved ownership via plan one, the 401k. 

The economy is completely skewed to favor owners instead of workers. It's how capitalism works. It's for the capitalists. The only people who get legitimately rich from work are famous performers. Star athletes, famous musicians, etc. Obviously, even they make more money when they are smart and license their image to ads, buy companies and promote them, or own the copyright to their music.

* DOL should maintain an overtime threshold that does not punish businesses in lower-cost regions (e.g., the southeast United States)
* Congress should clarify that the “regular rate” for overtime pay is based on the salary paid rather than all benefits provided.
* Congress should provide flexibility to employers and employees to calculate the overtime period over a longer number of weeks.

the only way I get to post is point 3 (which is stating that employees should be able to flex over a larger period of time like 3 to 4 weeks.  which is already something exempt employees can do already.)

"I’m a pilot. Not only fo I usually have a 3 or 4 day workweek, but I also prefer, and usually have no problem arranging, to start my workweek on Sunday. So I’ll typically work Sunday-Wednesday. But also, I almost never start work before noon. So on Sundays I’ll sleep in until 8-9 or so. I’ll take my time getting ready, drive to the airport and fly for a few hours. My workday is most often less than 8 hours. Typically a flight is 1-2 hours (I’m a domestic pilot so the furthest flight we have is only 3.5 hours). I might have 1-3 flights on day one. The most flights I’ve ever had was 5 in one day but those are usually short so maybe less than an hour total. So if I start my day at noon, I might be at the hotel by 5 pm. 

I get home Wednesdays (again, typically) but since we will usually start early in the morning on Wednesday (sometimes as early as 4-5 am) I can be home after 1-3 flights before 10am. So I basically have the entire rest of the day off. If I’m exhausted, yes I’ll have a nap. But then it’s like 1-2pm and I still have time to relax or do errands. 

Now, I still have Thursday Friday and Saturday off. Thursday I’m going to do errands or be lazy. The social day is either Friday or Saturday. And I can still be social late on Saturdays because, unlike the m-f 9-5ers, I don’t have to awake up at the crack of dawn on my first workday. So I never get the “late Sunday sad feelings” that most people get. 

I only have “3 days off” but since I got home early on Wednesday, and I leave later on Sunday, it feels more like having 4-4.5 days off. Even though I had a full workweek. I can pick up extra flights as are available if I want extra money. And I can post flights I don’t want to do to a trade board and someone else can pick them up for extra money. I’d say it works 30% of the time. 

If I call in sick, there no questions asked. You don’t want sick pilots. Not just to keep from spreading illness, but obviously vomiting during a landing isn’t ideal. So pilots rarely even need to provide doctors notes. Sometimes we do, but not often. (Just don’t abuse the system or they WILL see it as a pattern)

If I really need some time off more than 3-4 days, and I know it in advance, I can adjust my schedule a month ahead of time and push my workdays outside of that timeframe. I might work Sunday-Friday one week and take a week off, then Monday-Friday when I get back. I could have taken vacation so that I could get paid during that time off, but I don’t HAVE to use my vacation time if I am able to adjust my schedule. 

I get paid only when the plane doors are closed, but it’s good enough pay that I can’t complain even when there’s delays. If a flight it cancelled, they still pay me what it was expected to be.

"“Don’t get me started on Gen Z,” says a friend who should remain anonymous for her own protection. “They genuinely cannot understand that they have to work longer than eight hours a day.” Also, she goes on, in a furious tone, “they’re completely baffled by the fact they have to start at the bottom. They can’t understand why they can’t start on a mid-level, senior salary. It is insane.”

Ah yes, but talking of insanity: mental health. Mental health, which is so often used as a defence these days. Perhaps we were all deranged to work so hard when we started; perhaps our employers were taking gross advantage; perhaps those refusing to follow our example today won’t suffer burnout. 

Have women my age missed out in particular? Several female friends wistfully say they wished they’d thought harder about their own lives before now. “I’ve definitely given too much to work,” says one. Another, also in law, sends me a sad message on this topic. “I got sucked into the buzz of the deals and prioritised work over everything else,” she says, “so I missed out on meeting the right person at the right time. I am happy, and have a nice life in the country in my mid-40s, but have no children which is a huge regret. I would definitely do things differently if I had a second go.”
If, if, if. “If my grandmother had wheels, she would have been a bike,” as that great philosopher and celebrity chef Gino D’Acampo once famously said on This Morning.

"What she seems to miss is that even her age peers didn’t necessarily work crazy hours so that they could move up through the ranks. For a lot of them, there is a glass ceiling. They would never advance to the level that she potentially could due to their school, acquaintances, or the fact that their family doesn’t own the actual business. 

They may not have been as interested in job titles so much as job security. A lot of people worked crazy hours because they were expected to & they needed a paycheck. And a lot of less privileged coworkers made career choices based on their current need for money & not their potential advancement. 

I lived with my parents after college for a few years so I could work a low paying position that gave me great skillset. I considered myself fortunate that I could do that. I had friends without any support system who *needed* to be completely self-supporting immediately after they graduated. They had to choose careers and jobs based on that. 

Now, my situation was very far from Money-Coutts. My parents were able to house and feed me for two years but that was the extent of what they could contribute. I never received any job-related benefit from being their child or from other family or friends. Despite this, I can still credit their help with making a difference in my career & life and consider myself more fortunate than others in my situation. 

Money-Counts cannot do this. She is a child of privilege who likely never had to weigh buying groceries against paying a bill on time. So, she builds herself up and expresses her superiority because she willingly worked hard. It’s a false equivalency. 

The fact that the work arena now has to accommodate 9-5 workers actually helps those who want to excel and advance. Because they can more easily stand out. It also can shine focus on productivity vs perception. I’ve worked with people who would tell management how late they would have to work and those same people would leave the office as soon as the coast is clear. I’ve worked with others who would do 1/2 the amount of work that I did but it was the number of hours we worked that was significant to management.

"I've met a lot of rich people in my day.  On top of never really being impressed by their intellect or work ethic, I have noticed they are always fucking miserable.  They are always stressed, always angry at everyone, always operating in crisis mode.  

I used to think it was as simple as the job.  That they had a lot of money because they worked a stressful job and the tradeoff for a lot of money was a lot of stress.  Sure thats true to a point, but its something much deeper than just the job.  Its a deep insecurity.  Rich people are driven by the need to look good in front of other rich people.  They're driven by the need to be accepted into high society.  Since this entire social scene is based off of having more than other people, they all have to one up each other.  It doesn't matter if you have enough money to pay off the national debt, if your golf buddy is bragging about closing a $5 million dollar deal, you're worthless scum unless you can come back bragging about a $6 million dollar deal at the next golf outing.  Their entire self worth is tied to how much better they are doing than someone else on a made up scorecard.  If you tell a rich person his investment will net him $1,000,000.50 and you hand him a check for $1 million, the only thing he will care about is where his $.50 went, because its not about what they have, its about what they want, and the only thing they want is more.  Nothing terrorizes them more than the thought of no longer being rich.  And since its all about comparision, every single thing in life is about making as much money as quickly as possible.  Because if they arent doing that, someone else is, then that person will be more rich than them.  And if enough people are more rich than you, than at a certain point you are no longer rich.  

rich people are trying to fill an empty pit inside of themselves.  They have often neglected their families, ethics, and sense of self in this pursuit.  But to acknowledge that would be extraordinarily painful, even more painful than not being rich.",lnk9zla,antiwork,1726577398.0

"OMG this reminds me of the time I was working at a restaurant a few years ago. I had just started working there and I was going to be going out of town for a few days, and since I was not in their system yet I mentioned it to them on my first day there. I was told that they would make a note of it, so I assumed that happened. When I did get added to their system, I noticed I had a shift scheduled during one of the days I would be gone, but I didn’t think much of it and I assumed that since I had let them know I would be gone, that they had made a note of that and I could just disregard the fact that I still somehow had a shift scheduled (I’d assumed they scheduled this shift before I told them and they forgot to take it off the schedule or something. It was also my first ever job so I was new to all this stuff). Well, come the day of the shift, and I had just finished having a fun day with a friend I met up with who lived in the place I was on vacation in, and not one single thought about work crossed my mind that day. My shift was scheduled for 4pm to midnight, but where I was it was an hour ahead of home, so at 5pm local time I get a call from my job informing me that I was supposed to be in that day. I told them that I was out of town and wouldn’t be able to come in even if I wanted to, because I was in a whole different state. What was I gonna do, book an immediate flight back home just to make my shift? LOL! I then said that I thought this was already worked out and I had let them know of my vacation on my first day on the job. Granted, I hadn’t been added to the system yet so I wasn’t able to properly request time off in the app, but I did let them know and it was on them to make a note of that. So anyway, thankfully I didn’t get fired or anything. But the manager did tell me that I needed to find someone else to cover my shift. Which I shouldn’t have to do while I’m on vacation. It should be on them to find someone to cover me, NOT me. Anyway, rant over.",l6up3i4,antiwork,1717379834.0

"My old employer pulled this on me twice.

First, booked the biggest vacation I've ever taken.   For context, growing up, my family never took vacations and never traveled. So this trip on my own with a bunch of friends was a big deal to me.

Plane lands, I get a cryptic message from my manager asking when I will be back.  It was so vague, I KNEW something was up.  Tl;dr the company had been sold while I was on the flight and nobody knew if our jobs were instantly eliminated or not.   Ruined my whole trip as I sat there wondering if I would be able to pay for it, whether I needed to focus on finding a new job or enjoying this trip, etc. Huge bummer.

Second incident at the same company (we didn't get fired, yay) but new manager.  Requested and was approved for a week off.   Second day off, at home, HR calls and asks why I abandoned my job. Huh? It's a pre-approved vacation. They had already decided it was abandonment and that was that. I spent that week off fighting their every attempt to pin that on me and went back to work as planned the following week. My manager at that time refused to even speak to me. Super unhappy to see me back.

They did end up laying me off like two weeks later just to get rid of me.  The primary issue was lack of training to do the work they wanted done and my manager at the time wasn't interested in teaching it.
It was all complicated and undocumented internal stuff nobody else uses anywhere so nobody walked in knowing it. You had to get trained.  New hires got sent to a month of classes.  As an existing employee, I got nothin and the company had a well-known policy that not being trained was the employee's fault and not a valid excuse.

"Healthcare insurance in the US is a smoke and mirrors illusion. My primary care doc explained the issue with me. Some drugs are really cheap but you overpay for them with your $15 co-pay. For example one medication I took was literally $4.00 without insurance at the pharmacy. With my insurance, it was $15. So I didn't show my insurance and got it for $4. The pharmacy is under contract with the insurance company to charge the co-pay, which works out well for them.
Here's another one. A friend was charged $400 on their hospital billing statement for a front wheeled walker. You can purchase a medical grade front wheeled walker for about $40-$50 from Wal-Mart. So what the billing statement says is something like $400 billed/Insurance Paid $75/Hospital adjustment $150/Patient to pay $175. Patient payment applied toward $1000 deductible or stop gap.
So you have paid $175 for a $50 front wheeled walker. The hospital gets $250 for an item they probably purchased wholesale for about $25. The whole ""contract adjustment"" is just b.s. to make you think they are nice people. 
My point is Americans are paying the majority of the cost of their Healthcare. The insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, the hospitals all cry to the media and their lobbyists cry to Congress about how they can't afford to charge less or pay more. 
It's all a scam. A racket. Every one of them is making money. A lot of money. The only people losing money are the consumers.
It doesn't have to be this way. But we have to collectively stop accepting the healthcare status quo and stop drinking medical-industrial complex kool-aid.

Friday you worked, Saturday you can kind of kick back a little, and the Sunday is dreading work and usually doing a lot of errands/chores. It's just not enough time.

As Sanders and many others have said, workers are more productive than ever, but due to inflation, stagnating wages and overall wealth inequality, we're also getting fucked more than ever. If you're not going to pay me more, at LEAST allow me to work less for the same shit pay I currently have. But, that'll never happen, probably not in my lifetime. I'm 38 now and I doubt I will ever live to see a federal law dictating that full time work is 32 hours. So many business owners/control freaks would try and have already tried to get folks to panic that their business would shut down and the economy would collapse if we did this. It's disgusting. And it's even more disgusting that the party in this country who should be advocating for the 4-day workweek barely fucking mentions it except for those who are considered 'fringe' candidates. It shouldn't just be Bernie and a select few others pushing for this. Every single democrat should be advocating for this.

I have too many roots down already to move and am not financially secure enough anyway, but I do fantasize about it often. Maybe once the in-laws pass on I can convince my wife to just get the fuck out of this shithole, broken country and never, ever look back. One can dream. I think one of the sadder aspects of American culture now is just how many people have been brainwashed into thinking being overworked and underpaid and on the 'grind' is a good thing or something to take pride in. Not only have we normalized being fucked in the ass, but a large percentage of Americans are actively hostile to the idea of working less, like their soul would evaporate if they weren't constantly 'grinding' for the rich. Just like a lot of Americans are actively hostile to the idea of free healthcare, because MUH TAX DOLLARS SHOULDN'T PAY FOR SOMEONE ELSE, nevermind that they turn a blind eye 850 billion DoD budget and that they fail every audit, year after year, due to mismanagement and waste of those funds that most cannot even begin to comprehend.",lngqgo8,antiwork,1726518209.0

"# BOEING AND MIND CONTROL TORTURE; CAN WE HAVE A HUGE DAILY ONGOING THREAD FOR YEARS SO WE CAN KEEP THE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED OUT THERE FLOWING???

**DO NOT WORK FOR BOEING!!!!!!!!! YOU ARE PUTTING YOUR LIVES AT RISK!**

After the obvious murders of 2 whistleblowers at Boeing, can we please have one or several ongoing, high profile threads in honor of the people who were killed? And I would also like to start a movement to warn current employees and those potentially thinking about being employed at Boeing about the risks.

**THERE IS A VERY STRONG POSSIBILITY THAT SOMEONE IN THE GOVERNMENT USED THOUGHT CONTROL ON THE WHISTLEBLOWER THAT SHOT HIMSELF.**

**IF YOU DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY EXISTS, RESEARCH NEURALINK BY ELON MUSK. IT IS MOST DEFINITELY POSSIBLE. I AM NOT ACCUSING MUSK OF ANY INVOLVEMENT HERE BUT I AM USING THIS AS A SCIENTIFIC EXAMPLE OF HOW IT IS POSSIBLE.** I am certain that this technology has been around since the 80/s and 90s.

Disclaimer

A. I am **not** a targeted individual, I **do not** hear any voices other than my own, but I have done over a decade of research on this topic because it fascinates me. I am a former amateur radio operator. I am not crazy, I am not a survivalist. I don't believe the government is controlling everyone simultaneously with this, but they have the ability to enter in to anybody's mind that has the chip, display visuals that look like daydreams, and can make them think or say potentially anything they want with or without the person being consciously aware of it.

B. I do not work for the government. I am a civilian utility locator.

Theory 1 - The US government, possibly in conjunction with top ranking Boeing board members used the nation's thought control apparatus to torture **John Barnett** possibly threatening his family with murder. **OTHERWISE THE GUY WOULDN'T HAVE SHOT HIMSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF A COURT CASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

Theory 2 (I don't think this is as plausible as theory 1 but I'll bite) A government or Boeing assassin had him murdered.

As far as **Joshua Dean** and the illness, my guess is that theory 1 came into play, didn't work so well when the guy wouldn't kill himself and someone intentionally infected him.

PS, here is a potential (hypothetical) method for detecting these chips, assuming that the chip is constantly transmitting radio waves.

1. Build a faraday cage. It has to block ALL incoming radio signals. MAKE SURE TO PUT IN METAL VENTS BENT AT SEVERAL ANGLES SO IT IS WELL VENTALATED. RUN A BUNCH OF WIRES FROM BOTH THE VENTS AND THE FARADAY CAGE ITSELF. THERE SHOULD BE NO HOLES IN IT OTHER THAN THE VENTS.
2. You will need a radio spectrum analyzer ( rf spectrum analyzer ) **ON BATTERY POWER ONLY,** **NOT THE CHEAP ONES THE WILL NOT WORK, YOU WOULD NEED ONE THAT GOES FROM 0HZ TO 828904830890423890423890823490850298 Mhz** (you know what I mean). Because if my guess is right they are really really high up in the radio spectrum.

Place the spectrum analyzer inside the faraday cage without you in it and see if it detects anything. Then step in to the faraday cage with the spectrum analyzer. DO NOT HAVE A CELL PHONE ANYWHERE CLOSE OR ANY KIND OF WIFI DEVICE ENABLED, OR ANYTHING AT ALL THAT EMITS RADIO WAVES.

And boom, you just found the uplink frequency of the chip if it exists, but again **THIS IS ASSUMING THAT THE CHIP IS CONSTANTLY TRANSMITTING.**

"your plan is okay. after you get an offer keep on asking ""is that all you can do?"" in different ways. Ask for help basically. after you have made your case the other party will feel like helping you is helping themselves, at least to some point.

after they arrive at a really high number ask them if they are sure this is it? they might say yes, they might increase. continue asking until they say yes that is really the absolute best.

Then ask them how you can accept this. How can I accept this offer knowing that you will just let me go anyway? this question is key because now that they have put the max amount on the table you go after what you really need. Job security. if they cant offer it its over.

Management thrives on being underhanded and sneaky and catching you unawares. In my experience, they are TERRIBLE at being secretive, so if you feel “the vibe” that they’re prepping you for termination, you’re not going crazy—you’re absolutely right. Therefore, do not make it easy for them and do not play their games. Any extra work you were doing, stop doing it. Reduce your workload to the lowest amount that could be considered actual work.

Then I had a meeting with the directors and told them that the deadline is quickly approaching and will not be met if two things didn't happen. Training needs to be postponed until after the deadline and I need to be under contract prior to the deadline. The terms of the contract include project completion and my contract expires when I secure employment elsewhere.


Given that the deadline was quickly approaching, they didn't have a lot of time to waste. They tried to threaten me with termination and even a lawsuit but I called their bluff and they signed the contract.

"It's easy for a lot of people here to say ""Just don't go in"" or ""Your mental health is more important than work"" or ""Flip off your boss."" And all of those are legitimate and justifiable responses. 

But the reality is that we live in capitalist society, and very few people are in a position to do any of those things. We have to deal with the fact that we need to pay rent this month and continue to pay rent moving forward, and advocating for ourselves and our mental health is not always conducive to paying rent. 

And being homeless is going be harder on our mental health than going into work while grieving, and it is a tragic reality that many of us have to work with. 

I empathize, and I sympathize. I was in a situation at work where I was speaking to HR and requesting to report to somebody other than my current supervisor because of harassment, and they said ""If we are unable to move you to a different manager, will you be able to continue to report to your current manager."" I just said, ""We live in a capitalist society, and I have rent to pay, so I have to report to whomever you say or risk being homeless, but know that if I continue to report to this person, it will be hurting me.""

No change. 

If you are in a position where you can tell your boss to fuck off, or you can say ""Sorry... I need time for my mental health,"" then do it. If you aren't, people expect us to bite down and swallow our pain, and it fucking sucks. 

If that's the case, identify where you want to be, figure how you can get there, and start working toward that.

Essentially it's a way for businesses to make you work an hour extra (you are certainly out of your house an hour longer) without them having to pay you for it.

The unpaid 1 hour lunch was especially common when I worked in retail.  That way they could have you work 9-6 (or whatever) for more coverage while only having to pay you for 8 of those 9 hours.  In the case of retail the extra shift coverage very much benefits the company; they can have only 2 shifts worth of workers  cover 18 hours of being open (morning shift, evening shift, and a very light split shift in the middle of those to cover the others' lunch breaks).",l61uf91,antiwork,1716916863.0

I'd leave every single day to go outside, eat on the parking lot and walk around the building.

In my current job I do 8-4, I skip lunch and graze on snacks, sandwiches and fruit by my desk. I could 100% do this job from home but the boss just hates this idea.

"I dont think it has to do with affordability of owners, per sé. But more of the economic impacts it ripples out to. 
It's a general rule of thumb if you increase payouts, there will be more money in circulation. Means inflations. Means prices will adjust to match the payouts. 
Getting examples like I believe San Fransisco. Where living becomes unaffordable if you are unemployed or a low earner (Relative to your local place.) 
It's good for consumption, because you have a higher buying power compared to other states. But pretty bad for (most people) to earn money by exporting. Since you will most likely be the most expensive state/nation to buy from.
Thats why china pegs its currency to the dollar and is the biggest owner of foreign currency like the dollar. To lower their own value of the yen compared to the Us or euro. So they can more easily export products. 

I understand what is meant by higher wages, but all your doing is making the richer and the poorer more incredibly poor. As now their bread will go from lets say 2 dollar to maybe 3.5 dollar. Because prices are adjusted for inflation.
It also means less jobs. And thus increasing the pool of people hurt most by this change.
Why: because it will be more expensive to employ workers so more jobs will be automated, or serious efficiency restructures. Putting hundreds to thousands out of their job. And becoming the pool of people that will be struggling even harder to come by, because of higher prices. 

TDLR: !!!!

Tldr: The pool of people most hurt by these changes will also increase in volume. Thus making the unfortunate, more unfortunate. And more people become unfortunate. The richer get richer and poor stay absolute BROKE.

Edit: And the fun fact becomes, it ends up making the owners even more revenue since their consumers have more gross money in their pockets. Meaning they will earn more gross revenue. This becomes a vicious-cycle. Everytime you increase minimum wage, you increase their gross revenue. Thus becoming a principle problem, just like the car industry of: Just add another lane.

"Ha! Last year, in a local district I used to teach in had a group of teachers/administration get the district sued because they screwed with the wrong student who has special needs. Results: A new administrator was demoted to teacher. A teacher was moved to a different classroom and has a letter in her file that she can't work in special education at all. Another teacher was moved to a less demanding position in the Pre-K program. The district agreed to a multimillion dollar settlement... and these people are still in working for the district. 

This year, the district is now facing another lawsuit brought by the same family for the same exact things! They've haven't even been in school for a month!  During the deposition, it became incredibly apparent the district would be losing the battle again. To fight back, they manipulated a 275lb, 6 foot tall teacher into pressing kidnapping charges against the 70lb (yes seventy) 5 foot tall fifth grade student with autism who wouldn't leave the classroom for lunch. There was still 5 minutes left on his reading timer so he continued to read quietly at his desk.  Instead of following the IEP and BIP,  or even just waiting 5 minutes, they decided to try and restrain him (when he's physically confronted he becomes a cat. He will crawl on the floor, mew and hiss, and lick his paw). They were in a Huge violation of his IEP, BIP, obviously ANY reasonable classroom management structure, and CPI guidelines. The family immediately filed for an investigation. In retaliation (fear), the district manipulated the teacher to file criminal charges against the student for kidnapping because she couldn't leave the room without him and assault because he arched his back, hissed and stuck his claw out at her ass she was trying to restrain him. The state investigated and threw the charges out. So the district then pressured the teacher to file in civil court. The teacher now has criminal charges pressed on her BY THE STATE for filing a prior false police report (kidnapping/assault) and harassment. 

Yet, she's still employed. How are any of them still employed? In this district only 29% of the teachers have a degree and are licensed. Everyone else is a long term sub. 

 In 1st grade this student was reading and doing math at a highschool level. A Doogie Houser in the making. Sweetest kid in the world. If you have to mess with his schedule, just show him where you'll make up the time and stick to your word. He was always agreeable, and he would even allow for contingencies he understood were out of your control. That's it. That's all. That's his rub --schedules are very important and literal to him. And the district is in the hole for millions of dollars and personnel are losing professional credibility all because of a power struggle with an 10 year-old kid over the issue of 5 minutes. A child who should be supported and celebrated for his intellect, is being harassed because his parents demand the school follow his IEP and BIP. And yet, they're all still employed. I suspect it's like this everywhere now. No one will go into teaching anymore so they have to scrape the bottom of the barrel. 

Oh, last time they won, the family bought a 5,000 square foot house with a huge swimming pool, 3 car garage, and 5,000 square foot unfinished basement. I wonder what they'll do with the next award. Finish the basement or buy a vacation home in the Hamptons? I mean the district has a choice to be their cash cow, or just simply do their job--follow the IEP/BIP, and get out of the way of this student's educational and intellectual progress.",lkby3q3,antiwork,1724848717.0

When you look at the US economy, a huge portion is auto manufacturing and petroleum. I can absolutely see the feds offering big corporations incentives for return to office demands.

I worked for a privately held mega corporation during COVID. The health department forced them to go to WFH. They made the leap and ended the lease where I worked. Parking sucked and was a huge issue anyway. Half the staff would be out sick as flu spread. Work from home dropped the absentee rate, allowed them to find candidates to be fully staffed. Productivity was up and if you weren’t working, you could only keep your job if you reported on site.

I was transferred to a new office across town but continued to WFH. Survey after survey showed 80% of the staff would quit if not WFH. They also paid less than on site jobs. 

The company kept threatening and people kept quitting (it was not a soft layoff). They begged me to return to work. 

None of it made any sense as management was leaving as well. The only thing that made sense is that they must have been offered some type of huge incentive at the top to get people back in the office. There were workers who lived an hour drive away because they closed down a branch across town and the cost of that commute made the decision to quit an easy one. You could get a fast food job making more.

"This is exactly what the union is for and the union contract should have provisions against retaliation. OP's manager's retaliation is actually a violation of the NLRB if not. So, OP has now gone from asking a question - and FTR, canceling breaks IS actually illegal on its own w/o a union - to needing the union rep to stand up to the boss. 

Laws Broken according to OP's post:

1.) Canceling breaks (which the company remedied).

2.) Retaliation for alerting your union (NLRB).

3.) Telling you that you should arrive 15 minutes BEFORE your shift. Legally, you're not required to arrive until the :00 or :15 or :30 of your start time. If your boss is requiring you to arrive BEFORE that time, that's considered off the clock hours and thus wage theft. You are required to be there when your shift starts. If they require you to be there before then your shift starts before. For example, if you're supposed to be there at 9:00 AM for your 9:00 AM shift and they require you to be there at 8:45 AM then your shift starts (as does your pay) at 8:45 AM. If, however, you choose to get there at 8:45 AM so you can grab coffee, hit the restroom, etc. in ADVANCE of your shift that is your choice because the shift starts at 9:00 AM. 

  
The union would not normally ""snitch,"" but in small shops it's not hard to figure things out as OP pointed in their update. 

Either way, OP now has actual grievances that the union needs to step in to address/redress with the employer. And, if OP does quit/are forced to quit/etc. they need an employment lawyer (which the union likely has on speed dial) to sue the company for 1.) violating the laws (breaks + arrival time) and 2.) retaliation. That the retaliation also includes law breaking (point #3) underscores the entire point.

  
My guess is that if the union steps in, they have strong grounds for disciplinary action against the boss for putting the company in a position to be sued. If the company addresses these issues and disciplines the boss (or fires them because they're now a legal liability) then they mitigate their legal risk with OP because they addressed the issue. If the boss stays and continues to retaliate, it's important for OP to continue documenting this w/ the union because that remains illegal, but far from unheard of.

  
I posted this, not just for OP, but so that others know their rights. OP is fortunate to have union representation which many people do not have. These rights stand, even without a union because they're base worker's rights laws. Again, it requires an employment lawyer and what one earns may not be much more than a few bucks and the satisfaction of winning, but the employer would be required to pay the attorney's fees which makes securing a lawyer easier. Even in at-will states, employers are not allowed to break the laws and can be held to account.",l8i0ewg,antiwork,1718319764.0

If notice is not properly given, the employee is entitled to overtime pay for the shift. If a permanent shift change occurs, the employee is entitled to overtime for the first two shifts of the new schedule. 

Assuming OP is in Michigan, I have worked with ther DoL in the past and find them to be highly efficient and more focused on the worker's rights than in similarly blue states. You may be able to get the DoL to investigate if this is a pattern. If it is, they will give you all their findings and resources to secure representation as well as notify the company of their violations and recommend they change their practices.

"Hey, IAM751 member here. I've been providing extra context on these posts.

Since it's been brought up a lot, the reason we have 96% to strike and 95% to reject is that rejection takes a majority (51%) and strike takes a super majority (66%) so people who vote yes on the contract will still vote yes to a strike as a show of solidarity. Much love to my union brothers and sisters who agreed to the contract but were still willing to put their livelihoods on the line for the rest of us. 

As a point of context, the union leadership tried to sell us out on this contract. They recommended this contract and hid important things that were being taken from us. Unfortunately for them, our members read the contract, not just the union information packet.💪

I was incredibly proud to see our membership stand up for itself, despite both the union and the Boeing leadership trying to guilt us into taking the contract. This strike will likely be an unlawful labor practice strike due to coercion measures taken by the company to convince us to accept the contract and try to stop us from communicating with each other. 

There will likely be a movement to attempt to replace our leadership after the strike is over.

"Many years ago, when I tried to explain to my manager, Mike, that the latest project would require more time than he allotted, he told me a story:

As a teenager, Mike had worked at a fast food restaurant. There was an external seating area at this restaurant they called ""the enclosure."" It was well known for getting very, very messy.

One day Mike was told by his manager to clean up the enclosure. He was given one hour to do this.

He did his best. He gathered up all of the loose garbage, he wiped up all of the spills, he put everything in order that he could. However, at the end of that hour, the enclosure was not up to his manager's standards, and so he received an informal reprimand.

The next day, the enclosure was just as messy as ever, and so his manager decided to teach him a lesson. His manager said pointedly that he was going to clean up the enclosure perfectly, and do so in only 15 minutes, while Mike watched.

Sure enough, due to experience, planning, skill, and intelligence, his manager had this area perfect in less than 15 minutes. End of story.

And so, according to Mike, this taught him there was *always* enough time to get the work done, no matter what it was. I should not be making excuses about insufficient time.

What I wanted to say at this point: Okay, Mike, go ahead and write, test, and debug this code for me *yourself* in the two days you have allotted.

"Is this just not standard practice? If crew is unavailable beyond a certain point, the service gets terminated early. 

It’s a bit irresponsible to make the crew changeover point a minor station for this reason too. 

e.g. on a Great Western Railway service from Cardiff Central to Penzance, if there’s no crew to take over from the Cardiff Central crew at Bristol Temple Meads, then they’ll only be able to reach Bristol Temple Meads, as the crew isn’t able to work south of Bristol Temple Meads (either because they’d exceed their shift time, or they’re needed on a train headed the other way towards Cardiff Central from Portsmouth Harbour, Taunton or Penzance). This should be ok, since Bristol Temple Meads is a major station, so a lot of people would be leaving there anyway, and there’s decent alternatives to reach destinations like Taunton, Exeter St Davids and Plymouth from Bristol Temple Meads. 

However, if they stretched it out, and made the crew change at Worle, unavailable crew at Worle would mean people are stuck at a smallish station just outside Weston-super-Mare, with most services heading the wrong way, or only reaching Weston-super-Mare. 

It’s on the train operator if they set the crew changeover point to be the middle of nowhere, and then a lack of crew leads to passengers being stuck at a small station rather than a major one",kz1ysg6,antiwork,1712829952.0

Her workweek would be Friday through Tuesday, no extra pay when her workday would fall on a holiday but would get a comp day off ""when it could be scheduled"".  She would be first in line for manditory fill-in on her off-days.  She would be last in line to choose my vacation days which would be cut from 4 weeks to two because she'd be moving from hourly to salary.  She would become exempt salary with a 55+ hour  workweek based on how the other supervisors worked.

The manager got really pissed when she started laughing as she turned him down flat.  He told her to think about it and to tell him exactly why she turned this promotion down.  This is what she wrote:  

I get time and a half for OT, including Saturday (or Sunday) work, and double time for over 60 hours, 7th consecutive day worked, or holiday work, which is, except in emergencies, at my choice since I've the second heighest seniority. I work Mon - Friday and spend the weekend with friends and family, and I get better (union) health benifits and 16 years toward my pension that I can collect in another 14 years when I'll still be in my 40's.

"Full Context Below:


BEN SHAPIRO (HOST): And let's be real about this - it's insane that we haven't raised the retirement age in the United States. It's totally crazy. Joe Biden -- if that were the case, Joe Biden should not be running for president. OK? Joe Biden is 81 years old. The retirement age in the United States, at which you start to receive Social Security and you are eligible for Medicare, is 65. Joe Biden has technically been eligible for Social Security and Medicare for 16 years, and he wants to continue in office until he is 86, which is 19 years past when he would be eligible for retirement. No one in the United States should be retiring at 65 years old. Frankly, I think retirement itself is a stupid idea unless you have some sort of health problem. Everybody that I know who is -- who is elderly, who has retired, is dead within five years. And if you talk to people who are elderly and they lose their purpose in life by losing their job and they stop working, things go to hell in a handbasket real quick.


But put all of that aside, just on a fiscal level and on a logical level, when Franklin Delano Roosevelt established 65 as the retirement age, the average life expectancy in the United States was 63 years old. Today, the average life expectancy in the United States is close to 80. It's totally insane that you believe that you should be able to work from the time that you are essentially 20 to the time that you are 65 -- which is a 45 year period -- pay in, and then you'll receive Social Security benefits sufficient to support you and your family, you and your wife or whatever, for, like, another 20 years. That's crazy talk. That is not fiscally sustainable. The notion that if you have to raise the retirement age to 67 or 68, that everyone is gonna fall apart -- my parents are that age. My parents are not retired, and they shouldn't retire. It would be very bad for them to retire.


By the way, it's disrespectful to people who are 67, 68, 69 years old to suggest that they are in the same shape as people who are 65 -- were in 1940. It's not true at all. Have you met a 65 year old lately? 65 year-olds are not old in the United States. They're not. 68 year-olds are not old in the United States. Again, Joe Biden thinks he's not old, and that dude is running for president again, and that dude actually is old, and he's 81. I fail to see how a country in which our entire leadership class is 80 plus is telling you that we should have a retirement age of 65. It makes no sense at all.",kxjlo9s,antiwork,1711980067.0

Yes, when safety is on the line, I can pay attention. My issue is when it gets boring - like sitting at a desk. 

I also want to say, I've been to job corps. A big part of that is how to interview. The hardest part is getting and keeping control of the situation. 

Little things - subtly give them permission to ask the next question (little comments like ""next question?"")

And ALWAYS ask follow up. Doubly so when they ask ""do you have any questions for me?"" You can ask something like ""when can I start?"" As a joke (depending on he interviewer, that might give a point in your favor or it might subtract one. It's a crap shoot). But I'd recommend something specific to something they said.

I've been in various corporate settings across industries for over a decade, and I know how to play the game once I'm on the team. The trouble is that I don't know what the new team wants -- if I'm too open or not open enough, if I'm too personable or too cold, if I'm too casual or too formal. Did I smile at the wrong time? Was that a joke or was she being serious? Can they tell that my mouth is dry? Did I speak too much or too little?

"Ever hear about John picerne jr? His daddy is a massive national real estate developer from Rhode Island. He owns the company that manages on base housings for a ton of military bases. Back in 04 the W administration was trying to privatize everything in the military it could and the juiciest one was housing for the troops not in the barracks. Picerne got the deal to manage several army bases but here's the kicker:  _the Pentagon  lent  him  the  money  needed to  win  the  contract._  And he didn't have to make any payments on that loan FOR THE FIRST FIVE YEARS! Picerne Jr was 32 and from what I read only worked for his daddy's company. His only reference for getting a massive _multi-billion dollar loan_ was his family's close ties with Rhode island senator Jack reed who is on the armed services committee and (iirc) was the chairman at the time. Can you imagine how much easier your life would have been if someone just came up to you and gave you a _billion dollar loan_ interest free for five years? Bc everyone who paid taxes that year literally did just that for this son of a billionaire. And surprise surprise, a few years in tenants were so angry at how bad the conditions were that the company changed its name from picerne to corvais to try to hide the relationship. A few years after that my neighbor on fort Bragg, (technically it was the pope army airfield which is an old air force base fort bragg was adjacent too and absorbed in 2012) who had been complaining about a leak in their roof for literally years HAD THEIR ROOF COLLAPSE INTO THEIR LIVING ROOM! This happened right as Reuters was doing an indepth story on the shit show that was military housing so they highlighted John Picerne's douchbaggery in particular.

Bringing the economy to it's knees by demonstrating it is we the people and we the workers who make life possible.


ACTIONS:
Saving cash and be ready to support others in need in the short term.
Stock up on essentials
Coordinates national strikes across sectors of the economy:
cleaners for a week
Delivery inc food etc for a week
Fast food service workers two weeks
Transport workers (rail particularly) for a sustained period - this will mean breaking the law as it stands
THIS WILL HURT US BUT ONLY IN THE SHORT TERM.


Next wave: Construction, maintenance and service employees 


Hospital staff, contract workers, support staff administrators, personal assistants etc...


Rules;
1 save as much as you can
2 share it with those striking and in need
3 be prepared for scabs (those who work during strikes)
There will be those trying to take advantage during strikes too


Taking action against scabs and those trying to gain advantage:
No confrontation, 
No confrontation,
Share who they are, who they work for and what they are doing against the strikes.
Make sure they do not get services from other workers during or after the strikes. 
Prevent them from shopping -uf shops serve them, we must stop using that shop and close it down (temporarily)
Stop them from receiving ordered goods 


It is deeply regrettably that some people will be anti strike and others will try to take advantage. 


ANY BUSINESS THAT RETALIATES WILL BE SUBJECT TO IMMEDIATE AND ENDURING SERVICE OUTTAGES AND DUSRUPTIONS any workers affected by retaliation MUST BE supported out of common funds - This is why we save and why we must be ready to share.
