just because your friend does meth does not automatically make it acceptable for you to engage in the same behavior. In fact, you should discourage your friend from doing it or stop being their friend.

"Upwards of 70% of women in relationships with porn addicts end up with some degree of clinically diagnosable PTSD/CPTSD. *70%*. This is the same sort of trauma response as being neglected/abused throughout childhood, witnessing the horrors of war, etc. Many end up with eating disorders, su*cidal ideation, a myriad of self harm practices, insomnia, nightmares, severe depression and anxiety, and the list goes on and on. 

Addicts are inherently abusive. Porn addiction takes it to a whole other level for the partners because it so deeply affects their body image, self esteem, and self worth. And yet, still, all we hear about is the poor men and their limp dicks. When women meekly plead for help, they are given the blame, they are shamed, told they must be far, prudish, or ugly. Told they must have let themselves go or aren‚Äôt meeting their partners ‚Äúneeds‚Äù. All the while these women jump through hoops waxing and getting surgical augmentation, opening their bodies to any and all depraved nonsense that their porn sick partners pour on them in an impossible attempt to gain the interest of pathetic middle aged men who would rather jerk off over the toilet to filtered images of teenagers that wouldn‚Äôt give them the time of day in the real world. Men who degrade their wives for putting on weight after a baby but can‚Äôt even remember to brush their teeth.  Men who sit around in shit stained underwear scrolling Instagram looking at women who would be out and out disgusted at the thought of them.  

I have always had empathy for addicts, and I am truly saddened that societally we are engaged in a widespread grooming of our children by giving them open access to any and all manner of degrading, dehumanizing, and disgusting porn.  All because the grown men lose their shit at then mere mention of possibly having to age verify to look this crap up. They feel so *entitled* to access to any and all women‚Äôs bodies that the thought of having to type in a birthday has them screaming ‚Äúwah wah, my freedom‚Äù from the rooftops. They refuse to do any research into what harms are present in an action they spend hours a day doing. If anyone dares to mention how exploitative porn is they make false equivalences about all work being exploitative-as if being sexually abused for money and having a 9 to 5 are in any way congruent. 

I‚Äôm sick of it. I think it‚Äôs time for shame to make a comeback. We need to stop sleeping with porn users. We need to show our disgust when we interact with them. I‚Äôm sorry, but if getting aroused to teenagers being degraded, raped, and abused sexually isn‚Äôt shameful behavior, then wtf is?

All porn fuels trafficking. There is no ethical porn. There is no way to know if what you are watching is consensual, coerced, or that the performers are adults. People who had no proclivities towards arousal to children or relatives are allowing their brain to be hijacked by this garbage and becoming ped*phones and predators. Reports of incest have skyrocketed right alongside the popularity of that category on front page tube sites. If you aren‚Äôt a cis white hetero male, you are literally a porn category. Porn hates women. Porn hates minorities. Porn hates children. Enough is enough. Women and children are *suffering* badly right now all so these porn sick losers can have open access to their bodies, and it needs to stop. I‚Äôm furious. I‚Äôm beyond furious. It needs to stop. Women are waking up as they more and more realize what is actually going on and how it‚Äôs affecting the men around them, and those men will be lucky if we don‚Äôt burn the whole fucking place down when we do collectively open our eyes.

"I agree with this 100%. Men who monopolize this discourse with whining about their broken dicks are pathetic.

When choosing reasons for quitting porn, you'd expect ED to take a backseat to the rampant injustices perpetrated by the industry and its supporters, but that's not how men work. Most of them lack something key for being a positive force: empathy.

When you're a guy, empathy is (at best) disincentivized and (at worst) repressed. The closest thing you have to it is shame, an emotion rooted in ego, so for most of your life, that and pleasure are your two big motivators.

So for me, it's no wonder why men look at all of the terrible effects of porn and only think, ""aww willy no work :(""

Also, I should say an obligatory not all men, but I'm not saying that with the meaning commonly ascribed to it. The fact that ""not all men,"" plenty of men, are capable of empathy and not letting their minds be corrupted by porn shows that PAs and the emotional mutilation that makes them is *their responsibility to solve.* Like, we get that you probably weren't hugged enough as a child, but you're an adult now.

There's literally no end to the rabbit hole of what people who claim to be pro sex are okay with.

All liberal men have taught me is not to trust any man calling himself a feminist. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",lcy69yn,PornIsMisogyny,1720846852.0
"This is true. While conservatives are the enemy in plain sight, always have caution of left leaning men.

Being left leaning doesn‚Äôt make you non-sexist. There were some Soviet revolutionaries who viewed women as property, and thus as a result were subject to being ‚Äúrewarded‚Äù to Soviet men.

But even men whom are progressive in a feminist fashion, you need to be wary of. Some men get into feminism for their own reasons. Some do it to get laid, others do it to be ‚Äúpick mes‚Äù and grift, and some do it to derail the feminist movement for their own benefit. Look at how many female centered places (like a certain sub about chromosomes) bow and cater to these guys. There is also the outright malicious guys who use it to mask their evil intentions. 

Joseph Stain said that women needed to be liberated from capitalism and advocated feminism. However he himself was a huge womanizer and impregnated his 13 y/o mistress who he groomed in an orphanage, when the word got out the Soviet soldiers were committing mass rapes in Yugoslavia he said ‚Äúlet the men have their fun!‚Äù His second in command, Beria, was a sadistic serial killer and pedophile who raped so many girls that he lost count, he had a whole trafficking operation in Moscow and Stalin was in on it. He was also abusive to his daughter, which screwed up her mental health and led her to do bad choice after bad choice.

There are also the men who are progressive, but lazy minded. These men love women. They love women so much, they benefit from their wives doing all of the housework and mental load, while likely also requiring her to split the bills. They don‚Äôt ever take a look at their actions and how they personally help women. They just go to rallies and think that‚Äôs it. They think that not watching porn while in a relationship is it, which shows that they are doing it as a substitution for women and don‚Äôt know or care about the moral issues.

A lot of pro-porn feminism is run by men, with their token Madam√© being a figurehead and luring girls into and industry that kills them for their profit. Wolf in sheep‚Äôs clothing and all that.

The worst of those, in my opinion, is the evil shithole that is BNWO. It ticks all of the boxes, on top of being racist already. A lot of the children from these relationships have issues.

It is the worst time to be a human woman seeking comfort, love, respect, honesty, and security from fellow humans when all it takes to ruin her chances at finding love ever after is incognito mode and a lie. 

I just wish things never came to be this way. I wish porn never existed so I could have a chance of waking up without hating my being a woman. It feels like a dam broke open and there's no way of stopping the flood ‚Äî just forcing yourself to an awful fate filled with disappointment, heartbreak, and being with somebody who will choose to cheat/betray you while enjoying rape/abuse/trafficking because it's a convenient addiction. 


I feel like I am going insane, like I am the only human left among a society of aliens who have taken over humans as their hosts. 

I wish women put up more of a fight. I wish men could screw their heads on straight. I wish liberal feminists could see the oxymoron in ""ethical porn"". I wish more people cared. I wish there was a way to know those who use porn so I could remove them from my life. 


It should not take as much effort as it does to convince people to not treat me and women as sex objects. I should not have to beg and make my case against being cheated on. I should not need to feel like my standard is extremely high, when my standard is to not engage in cheating + misogynistic media of women and children being raped, abused, trafficked, and exploited.

One married manager kept talking to me calling me 'my dear', smiling, being extra kind, standing too close and I got the feeling I was being creeped on.

Their relationships with us is transactional. Sleeping with a lot of women impress other men. Having a long Life partner/being married/having a family is also met with respect from other men. Being single and sexless is literally the worst fate a male can have: see the incel movement, see how men tend to jump from relationship to relationship/have a backup option before leaving a relationship. See how vicously men react to breakups, and what other men think of fellow single men.

I am thankfully surrounded by not-so-bad men that mostly do not chase women for sex, but sometimes they definitely don't see women as people with their own inner world. Not really a big deal when dealing with colleagues/strangers (obviously you can't know everyone), but I am baffled when men can't wrap their heads around their female friends/ female partners having their own hobbies/Life.

To set some example, I have seen male friends surprised by women culture around makeup/fashion. As an anecdote, we were 4 women and a man and we started talking about eye shadow. This man tried to give his opinion, but it was obvious he had no idea what he was talking about and his opinion was (kindly) discarded quickly. I had a conversation later with him and he was totally bamboozled about It. Not because his opinion was dismissed (he understood he was no expert on the topic), but because he realized that level of deep knowledge was totally useless to impress or attract males who were mostly oblivious to everything related to makeup.

"I'm left wing, progressive, non religious. I'm against porn because I'm not really into women being abused. I know, I know, that's an unpopular view these days, but still

Conservatives are the louder side with being against porn, but IMHO they are against it for the wrong reasons. They're against porn because it's a ""sin,"" sex before marriage is bad, masturbation is bad (I know porn and masturbating are not the same thing but unfortunately a lot believe it to be), how it ruins mens ability to work down there. I never hear them mention the abuse and trafficking. In fact, I only hear left wing radical feminists mention the rape and trafficking part

People tend to view the world as black and white most of the time. If you're against porn, you're conservative, if you're for porn, you're liberal. They tend not to understand that there's many shades of gray (is this in poor taste?)

Left wing people who are against pornagraphy need to get louder, WAY LOUDER. Until we on the left stop normalizing porn and defending it like it's life or death, It will always be expected of us to support it. Unfortunately, back when 2nd wave feminism was around, the pro porn, pro sex work side got louder and won. Now we are left having to undo all of that

I have seen a bit of a change tho. Less women seem to be comfortable with their partners watching porn. I have also seen articles (although not as much as I'd like) talking about whether or not this pro porn/sex work culture has done more harm than good. I believe it has

To me porn is more of a human rights issue. Is it morality ok to violate a group of people for the satisfaction of a large group of people? Obviously no, but I think it should be spoken about as a human rights issue more so than whether it's cheating (I agree it is), sinful to watch (as in sexuality, not as in watching rape) etc

One of the darkest aspects of male sex addiction in particular is that talking about it and attention being called to it (positive/negative) is not just a substitute for the sex/porn addiction itself but is deeply interwoven with the fundamental urges they're seeking to satisfy. Sexual abusers are borderline impossible to treat because it's very common for sexual abusers to get satisfaction out of exposing their addiction to others, even if it's in the sense of them seeking to reform/recompense/regret what they've done. It makes sexual crimes difficult to study from a criminological perspective because to interview a rapist is to indulge them in their addiction and even if in theory they're on the road to recovery, it encourages them to relapse into old behaviors because they're getting tastes of the thrill.

Hypermasculine sexuality is centered around a diversity of mutilations and dominations. To tell people about how you're masturbating/abstaining from masturbation is a conspicuous act of violence, an assertion of power. This is why men both preach the virtues of sex positivity while also building death cults around the viciousness of sexuality in all its forms. Male pornographers get aroused from talking about sex but so do male priests and politicians when they talk about not having sex. The penis itself is a weapon but for men abusing their weapon is violence upon violence and therefore very arousing to them. It's a lose-lose situation for women because in both cases men are only doing/undoing it for their benefit and in service of a dialectic that orbits around the phallus.",l0ifv2y,PornIsMisogyny,1713650102.0

A majority of OnlyFans subscribers are married men, so the platform may be less an antidote to loneliness and more of a fidelity cheat code.

This twist comes from one of the first studies to break down OnlyFans‚Äô user demographics. After surveying 335 men and 383 women ages 18 to 71, researchers found that subscribers, on average, were 63 percent male, 68 percent white, and 89 percent married‚Äîwith 59 percent of users identifying as heterosexual and 37 percent identifying as bi or pansexual

When researchers analyzed the responses of 425 OnlyFans subscribers, of whom 53 percent identified as male, 45 percent as female, and 0.7 percent as nonbinary or gender nonconforming, 82 percent were currently in either a romantic and/or sexual relationship.

SEM = Sexually Explicit Material

Researchers have begun to examine the frequency and impact of SEM usage among individuals in relationships (Camp- bell & Kohut, 2017; Maas et al., 2018; Poulsen et al., 2013; Wright et al., 2017). On one hand, SEM usage may have deleterious effects on relationships (Doran & Price, 2014; Wright et al., 2017) and may contribute to lower levels of sexual satisfaction, commitment, and communication as well as higher rates of infidelity among couples (Bridges & Morokoff, 201 1; Brown et al., 2017; Morgan, 2011; Sun et al., 2016). In one study of 20,000 nationally represented couples, partners who viewed an X-rated film in the last year were significantly less likely to report happy marriages, were more likely to be previously divorced, and were more likely to have had an extramarital affair (Doran & Price, 2014). In a similar vein, a meta-analysis of 50 studies that included over 50,000 participants across 10 countries indicated SEM usage was associated with lower levels of interpersonal sat- isfaction (Wright et al., 2017). Indeed, SEM usage among one or both partners has been linked to lower self-esteem and poorer relationship quality, especially among women (Campbell.& Kohut, 2017; Carroll et al.,2017).

In no way am I defending some of his ideas. But like, one of the things that stuck with me the most was that he was constantly repeating how strong a man is regarding s3x and then defending that he only owes his wife s3x one time a month, the rest is charity. 

It‚Äôs contradictory (as he insisted men are strong enough to be with multiple women yet he kept making excuses for a husband not to have s3x with his wife), terrible and just ew. And I‚Äôm not saying there aren‚Äôt men that held ideas that were even worse. My point is simply that never in history have men had the chance to OPENLY be degenerates and infinitely consume p0rnographic content.

Men *love* being in groups of women, feeling important and directing groups of women, focusing on which issues are important, and eliminating porn is absolutely not one of those issues. Including men in the debate of feminist issues will always skew hard to their side, for a hell of a lot of women fear being ""a misandrist"" or being mocked as an ugly, hairy feminist.

"So was slavery, so was child labour. When we know better, we do better. 

Third wave or liberal/choice feminism became popularised a few years after the oral contraceptive pill revolutionised sexual/reproductive freedom for women. What started out as our liberation eventually became another tool for men to oppress us. So much easier to rape and coerce women into sex acts they don‚Äôt want when you frame it as freedom and liberation and when you‚Äôre largely free from consequences such as unwanted pregnancy. You get to throw in insults like ‚Äòfrigid‚Äô or ‚Äòpuritan‚Äô which of course no woman really wanted to be during that era. 

While I‚Äôm not remotely a conspiracy theorist, I wonder at times if the real reason the pill was made for women and not men was just more about control. Controlling women and their sexuality. Yes, men can‚Äôt handle side effects, but by gosh they can sure put up with blurred vision, chest pain and risk of cardiac events when they take a viagra. 

When the first ‚Äòmy body my choice‚Äô mantras started, they sounded empowering. It was silencing men - you can‚Äôt criticise us because it‚Äôs about choice. It‚Äôs about control of our own bodies. That actually felt pretty good, telling men that they couldn‚Äôt criticise us, regardless of whether we wanted to be a housewife or a career woman, whether we wanted to sleep around or not, but was it empowering? For all women? No. 

The biggest problem with choice feminism is that it silences criticism. That first rush of freedom to make choices that suited us personally and shout down any many who challenged us was heady and strong. But what about *freedom from*? Freedom from harm, from coercion, from exploitation? We didn‚Äôt really think about that, and we also shot down any women who criticised us. 

Over time, plenty of young women who feel the oppressive clutch of patriarchy in their youth will grab hold of the mantra and sing it loud and proud, like many Gen x of my ilk did in our 20s before our brains fully developed, before we really were able to assess the risks of the so-called ‚Äòchoices‚Äô we made, before *men were corrupted with high speed, 24/7, hardcore, abuse porn in their pockets every day* and began to join the chorus with the mantra, ‚Äòher body, her choice‚Äô. How convenient for them. 

I can only assume that the push behind liberal feminism was men. The pickme girls who valued the validation and attention of men over the solidarity of sisterhood, throwing other women under a bus and silencing them when they started to speak up and say, ‚Äòhang on, this new wave of feminism is all about serving men, not women‚Äô. 

Women are not perfect. We are not always right. Not every choice a woman makes is a feminist choice, but choice feminism says that‚Äôs okay, because it‚Äôs ‚Äôright for her‚Äô. Well, is it okay for her to make **any** choice that serves her in this moment? No. Some choices women make harm them. Some choices women make harm *all women*. 

We need to be free to be critical of women who make choices that harm us all. We need to be free to challenge notions of empowerment and power exchange. We need to be free to analyse and research and speak up, but choice feminism says I can‚Äôt criticise other women for choices they make. I‚Äôm a woman too though - how is it that they can openly criticise me? The choices women make that serve men are sacred cows. The challenge to those choices is silenced because men want the fun kind of feminism. The kind that entitles them to porn, prostitution, nudes and sex, free of responsibility, and the ability to create and maintain a sub class of women to provide all of this and to absorb their hatred for us and their desire to dominate and degrade and dehumanise and control. They get to keep the other class too, the class of women and girls who can be wives and mothers and daughters and are not to be mixed in with the sub class at all. It doesn‚Äôt matter if *other* women and girls are trafficked into that sub class, because the loudest liberal feminists - the ones with phones and social media, the ones who are somehow proud of their trauma and mental illnesses, those ones say they chose it, and we can not challenge them. The ones who don‚Äôt choose it have less of a voice. If you‚Äôre in a room in a dingy hotel or a cattle shed with a camera trained on you and five men in the room threatening you, and your passport is locked in a safe on another property, you don‚Äôt really have a voice, but we don‚Äôt care about those women, they‚Äôre inconvenient and get in the way of our empowerment mantra. 

No one wants to be seen as weak. No OnlyFans girl is going to admit to being scared (not yet), or being powerless. She‚Äôs not going to admit she‚Äôs not making money and that she finds her customers gross or threatening. That would mess with her empowerment mantra. Sadly, most of her clients would probably enjoy her work more if she admitted to being scared or disempowered, because that is exactly what they get off on. 

No woman is above criticism. No choice is allowable simply because it was made by a woman. Make a choice that doesn‚Äôt serve men and watch yourself get torn to shreds, not just by men, but by other women. These women have traded sisterhood and serving women as a class for a place at the table. The problem is, that place is not a seat, it‚Äôs on a plate. It‚Äôs called ‚Äòenacting a patriarchal bargain‚Äô and it‚Äôs not feminism. Sure, they win favor with men, and as a reward are elevated above other women, but they‚Äôre still below men, and they‚Äôve traded not only their own dignity and value for that place, they‚Äôve traded ours too, and I‚Äôm done with it.",kw64wfr,PornIsMisogyny,1711181274.0

"BOYS will be BOYS then

It's so absurd how there's this BIG GAP BETWEEN THESE TWO.

If boys will be boys, then why are men deemed more cool/ professional/ deserve a better po$ition with power? While the SOL and socioeconomic status for women lag behind men? Oh, because the big gap is called misogyny!

Boys get lifted up to men somehow, when they aren't even doing the bare minimum! Merely watching porn in public, instead of being productive and adding value to society like wise men should do.

If boys will be boys, then they should be treated like boys. Withhold benefit$. Definitely no sexy time too since they are to be deemed as boys.

But why are they still getting the pass for consuming and sharing porn, with and without people's consent in public?

Regardless the angle to support this MISOGYNISTIC ATTITUDE (also unfair to boys as it's like they can't learn to be wise men?!) of ""boys will be boys"", it just cannot make sense. It's illogical to allow this harmful thinking to propagate. Shame on the previous generation.

He doesn't have Google on it. He doesn't have safari or chrome or any web browser whatsoever on it. Every single app he wants to download needs to be approved by either myself or his dad. 

We're also super honest whenever he has questions and we try to keep communication very open. It's always weird having to answer questions in regards to sex or reproduction but I always try to keep in mind that these are things that I wish I could've trusted my parents to not be embarrassed to talk about.

"The BDSM community is full of genuine abusers who prey on those with trauma. Odd how they claim to be ‚Äúsafe, sane, consensual,‚Äù and yet have cases of death, injury, more trauma, and health problems when engaging in particular acts.

I don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs so sane about someone who gets off to things like knife play, gun play, needle play, impact play, sounding, and other deranged kinks.

The whole consent argument doesn‚Äôt work like many think it does, either. They claim that consent makes it all a-okay, but when someone consents to being murdered and eaten like the Cannibal Cafe case, it‚Äôs not okay. This can be applied to other things.

The man who killed them was still considered a murderer and got sent to prison.

But, when someone smacks and strangles their partner because they consented, they aren‚Äôt considered an abuser. Just because someone consented, doesn‚Äôt make that particular act okay. On top of that, someone with severe trauma sometimes lets their trauma guide their decisions.

Lastly, I'd encourage you to remind your sister and her friends that something is not feminist just because it's something commonly seen as something women and girls do. With young people like this, I think it's especially important to discuss these subjects calmly and with as little judgment as possible. Young people are still learning to navigate their way in a complex and often cruel and misogynistic world, and it's easy for them to feel like they, personally, are being attacked for their views.

"My best friend is like 5""6'ish and her bf-- who had been abusing her for a year-ish-- tried to sue her after she hit him when he wouldn't leave her apartment. His name was not on the lease, and he was not paying rent.


At that point, he had already coerced her into not using protection, and she got pregnant. He was supportive up until she suffered a miscarriage, in which he basically almost fully disappeared from her life. She got no support from him at all. I was there for her and heard about all the ways he'd guilt her and tried to make her feel like she was worthless. A short while after she miscarried, he strongly suggested opening up the relationship, except he forbade her from seeking out other men. Only other women. Obviously, this pissed her off.

Then he came over while taking his stuff back, and once everything was out of her place, he did this performance of, ""But wait! Now that I'm thinking about losing you, I don't want this!"". Except... he'd already done that several times, so she was done with his ass. He refused to leave and she eventually had a PTSD reaction where she hit him, trying to push him out the door. She described the moment as the panic taking over, and was confused and scared about it. He was over 6"" and fairly wide, but told the police he was ""scared for his life"". My friend is thin and has severe autoimmune arthritis. She was virtually no threat to him. She still felt guilty for weeks, and this worsened her grieving process by giving her even more confusing feelings to work through.

He threatened to sue, and a court order was issued. But he didn't show up the day of the first court session-- probably knowing the court would laugh at it and throw it out--, and my friend explained all those details he definitely left out. It was immediately dropped. He did it to threaten and intimidate her. Even worse, she's black, and he's white. Of course he stereotyped her as aggressive after pushing her beyond her limits! 

I hate him so much, especially after how he tried to suck up to me on her birthday. He became so transparent that day, even my partner was a little unsettled by how much he seemed to know how big of a role I play in her life, and specifically started waiting on me hand and foot at the party.

"As a woman who has had a PA partner but also doesn‚Äôt fully support SW, I feel like some people don‚Äôt see that the responsibility falls on multiple and not only one.

It‚Äôs not just the man‚Äôs fault for being addicted. It‚Äôs also the parents for not informing them and leading them in the right direction. Same way that it‚Äôs also Porns fault for existing due to currupt CEOs who feed on broken people. Same way it‚Äôs SW who also can take accountability for adding to the supply. 

If we compare it to drugs, there‚Äôs not one single party who is at fault. It‚Äôs the fault of the addict, the drug corps who process the drugs and the drug dealers who profit of off of the addicts and supply them (like how SW does) (if you want to get into what‚Äôs the worse of the evils that a completely different debate)

I don‚Äôt have animosity towards other woman but I can‚Äôt see how they are exempt from being part of the problem when they are actively involved in it. I mean, they even support these addicts and push the message that it‚Äôs harmless. I don‚Äôt see that as innocent either. 

I always feel that in terms of relationships and infidelity, the man (or cheating partner) is always the one to blame. I wouldn‚Äôt witch-hunt a woman for him cheating. I don‚Äôt blame her for his actions because ultimately, people who have a strong core moral value will not cheat even when given the opportunity. In that sense, it is only the man‚Äôs fault. 

However, if we are looking at it in terms of who is responsible for this pandemic of porn sickness, it‚Äôs NOT solely the man. No one is exempt. 

I wouldn‚Äôt exactly consider this anti-feminism or anything depending on the intent. If they are solely blaming the SW and simultaneously writing off excuses for their PA and making him seem like a helpless man who is a slave to his instincts then yes, I completely disagree and think that mentality is the complete opposite of progressive or helpful but I hope that maybe I can open a conversation about how many parties involved in this should be able to take accountability and not just one (albeit the man is definitely burdened with most the blame regardless)",la1h9g8,PornIsMisogyny,1719232598.0

"> I forgot how weird middle school boys can be. 

It‚Äôs a little bit worse than weird. With kindness, I want to point out how you‚Äôre minimising and excusing the sexually inappropriate behaviour of these boys. ‚ÄúWeird‚Äù is someone eating soup with a fork. These kids are misogynistic and sexually aggressive. 

> I sometimes feel someone brush up behind me‚Ä¶but when I turn around, it‚Äôs always the same boy‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs always on my ass. Maybe I‚Äôm overthinking, but it‚Äôs happened at least 3 times, and he‚Äôs not even in my class.  

You‚Äôre not imagining it, you‚Äôre not overthinking‚Ä¶ but you are gaslighting yourself. Of course that boy is rubbing your ass (I‚Äôm sorry, gross) and of course he knows what he‚Äôs doing.

It‚Äôs really important that you alert his counsellor asap. If possible, you should also tell your leader. His parents need to be notified and he needs to be disciplined or face some kind of consequences, even if it‚Äôs just a stern talk with you and his counsellor. Even though he‚Äôs young, this is technically sexual harassment happening in your workplace. If you had an HR person (which I know you don‚Äôt), they‚Äôd be the one to speak with.

I went through something similar when I was a kindergarten assistant. One little boy grabbed my ass a few times. First time I was too stunned to speak. Second time I told him that we don‚Äôt do that. Third time I spoke to his teacher, who spoke to him (and hopefully his parents?) and then he stopped.

 

> My assistant counselor caught some of the boys going to some of the girls saying things like ‚Äúcmon, he‚Äôs single and horny, help a poor guy out‚Äù. 

I mean, these boys are fucking menaces. And *no one* disciplines them because it‚Äôs summer camp and you don‚Äôt have the rules and structure that school does. They feel completely uninhibited and invincible‚Ä¶ the freedom of camp. I remember that! But I wasn‚Äôt a sex pest.

> I can‚Äôt blame them, they‚Äôre only children and don‚Äôt have much awareness/empathy yet, 

Eh, not really. I‚Äôm a teacher. I studied early childhood development and I‚Äôve also seen this firsthand: children start developing empathy around age 5. These older boys are WELL AWARE that they‚Äôre doing something wrong which makes their female counsellors and female peers feel bad in some way. Feeling uncomfortable, upset, annoyed, angry, violated. (These boys learned about feeling violated when they were in the first fucking grade. They learned a very long time ago about private parts, consent, and inappropriate sexual remarks.)

You can determine if someone has empathy by observing if they behave badly with everyone or just with select people. If they‚Äôre able to control themselves by carefully choosing who they harass, they ABSOLUTELY know that it‚Äôs wrong and it makes people feel bad. In short, middle schoolers are fully capable of empathy and self-control. Their brains can do it. And most kids at that age *do* have empathy and self-control. But these boys *in particular* either lack those traits or choose not to exercise them because campers don‚Äôt get punished.

> I hope one day to be able to give talks at elementary and middle schools about the harms of porn, and I want to be involved in whatever kind of advocacy I can be to push federal age verification laws. 

That‚Äôs amazing. You can do it!

> Maybe I‚Äôm being dramatic, 

No. Please stop gaslighting yourself. What‚Äôs next, are you going to dismiss your feelings about something because ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on my period so I‚Äôm acting bitchy‚Äù? No. Overreacting, overthinking, being dramatic‚Äîthese are misogynistic terms designed to make women shut up and fall in line.

I went to the hospital and got put on some meds, and they‚Äôve helped tremendously, but they can only help so much when the reason why I attempted is alive and well. Before this, I just assumed porn was a thing that men watched occasionally and stopped during relationships. This turned my whole worldview upside down. Now, I see how obvious it is that they were all watching it during our relationship and it‚Äôs really hard to deal with. I have struggled with body dysmorphia and depression for a long time and it‚Äôs only gotten worse.

I recently got out of a relationship with a PA. It ruined our relationship and any chance of a friendship. I couldn't trust him, and it made me doubt myself. It's only been a few weeks since then, but reading self-help books and reconnecting with family has helped me tremendously. Unfortunately, I don't see myself dating again. I'm petrified of putting myself through that cycle again. I'd rather just focus on bettering myself, not having to worry to that severe degree ever again, and learning to love myself.

"Pain does release endorphins in people, which can create a feeling of peace or euphoria. This is part of why self-harm, such as cutting, is used as a relief from mental distress. 

The biological reason is probably so we are able to withstand the pain of wounds enough to not be distracted from a goal. For example, if you get injured in the middle of a mammoth hunt or collecting sea-bird eggs, you want enough clarity and time to finish gaining the desired resources. 

HOWEVER, this is radically different than wanting to violate somebody's autonomy or having your autonomy violated. 

On the rapist side, this is just abhorrent, and I have no good explanation for it other than some people enjoying the infliction of cruelty, distress, and harm.

On the persons side who wants to be violated, this is a *NEGATIVE* response to trauma. It is a self harming behavior born from having a shattered self-esteem and ego and a loss of pesonal autonomy in the psyche. Essentially, abuse replaces what the body normally expects of a sexual situation to try to adapt and rationalize to the abuse one has suffered. 

It is a horribly saddening phenomenon that many  men who enjoy inflicting harm are currently exploiting to their advantage through trying to normalize, and even disgustingly promote self harm as a form of treatment through reliving ones abuse. 

My degree is in psychology, and I edit papers for national journal publications. None of us who practice in this field condone the normalization and use of repeating your trauma as a form of treatment.",lnyp7bd,PornIsMisogyny,1726785663.0

"As a survivor of CSEM that includes torture, it's honestly at a level of depravity and violence that idek how they manage to do worse anymore. I mean unfortunately I know people who are still wrapped up in abuse so I get updates on what abusers are up to but my experience was so horrid it's hard to conceptualize worse.

Killing children on screen and pedo-necrophilia is standard shit now. The only limit is ""making"" a supply of children who will not be tracked (because if the kid is registered as a citizen/resident it's kind of obvious if they're dead). So there's a lot of outsourcing to remote areas, second and third world countries etc.

They use lolicon and shotacon to ""prime"" the kids so they'll do a better ""performance."" Happened to me, happened to a bunch of my other survivor friends. Standard shit.

They make kids watch CSEM back and critique us like it's an acting career.

They abuse fetuses cut out of teenage/preteen girls and then abuse the girls.

They breed kids like we're cows.

More and more of them are using AI and virtual reality headsets to better prime kids (aka programming).

They make up fake religions to make us think it's our only purpose.

If you're wondering if the cannibalism shit is real, yes it is, it's not even niche anymore in the CSEM world.

My abuse started at 6 months and I'm lucky to even have my reproductive system intact and all 4 limbs because they were """"""gentle"""""" with me.

No fap isn't even about the negatives of masturbation anymore. It's worse now because it's been co-opted by the grindset mindset. Now it's being sold as a way to fix men's lives and how it can help them attract women or get more confident to be rich. It's also worse with how some believe that the best replacement to masturbation is just have sex. So women are objectified in a way where they're seen as a solution to men's problems. Like they're just there for sex and to help men feel good.,lle69d0,PornIsMisogyny,1725410282.0

"I realized that community, and many of the related, were full of crap early on. 

Nothing of value ever gets talked about, and if you do post something about the industry, anti-porn, or looking deep into *why* you might have latched onto porn, like learned misogyny, skewed views on women, sex, relationships, etc., the posts get ignored.

Half the posts are just guys complaining that they failed on day whatever, as if x amount of days is the cure...if that was the case, as with any problematic behavior, when people go to jail and don't use or do their habit or behavior of choice, then with enough time away, it;d be done, but that doesn't always happen, and usually doesn't until their is some self reflection.

Most guys on those communities would still watch porn, given everything that comes with it, as long as there were no sexual issues.

I got fed up with those communities, and decided to look into the one place i hadn't read into before, which was feminism at the time. That led me to Andrea Dworkin and eventually here.",llghi13,PornIsMisogyny,1725453508.0
"The problem isn't the women in porn. The problem is pornographers that do promote it everywhere knowing the harms and do allow people to be abused and harmed while making it. The problem is groomers teaching it should be advertised via reels etc on platforms designed for 13+ where young and vulnerable teens can watch it, find links to their sites and get addicted. The problem is people thinking they are normal for watching someone else being harmed and exploited for them to get off. The problem is the people doing it of their own free will like OF etc telling others it's glamourous and empowering for them while other women are being forced and harmed by the industry. It's basically laughing in their face. The no fap guys don't care if women are harmed. They don't care about anything but themselves and the problems their own choices have caused them.",llfxs28,PornIsMisogyny,1725443408.0
"Nofap men are usually even more misogynistic than other dudes can be, it seems to me. I think they might be so bad because this is the subset of the population who has already developed an addiction to using and objectifying women for ""enjoyment."" Nofappers can't identify and usually simply don't care about the real reasons why porn is so deleterious to society (chiefly women). They just can't reason beyond themselves. It's always some selfish retarded reason they cite...

Many of them actually blame the sex workers/porn actresses for luring them like porn sirens to have them drown at sea. They paint themselves as these helpless, abused fools who are being taken advantage of by all the porn stars/anime waifus forcing their hands. Wtf.

How can they blame these women anyway? Porn stars and sex workers are victims of a much greater evil and the actual driver of this whole porn crisis... that is, ongoing misogyny/patriarchy.

They are not in any way, shape, or form victims. You either critically think about something uncomfortable or you can decide to evade it/double down in the wrong direction. Most porn addicts choose the path that elicits them the least shame, remorse, accountability, or responsibility for their actions. They willingly and knowledgeably chose to get hooked on porn and then ignore what's actually wrong with it.

I'm not against masturbation anyhow, so nofap just makes no sense to me. They're missing the mark in more than one way, for sure.

Porn is the problem. Porn is what needs to be excised... and that's because that would mean we've finally solved the inequities in society that have led to messed up, male-servicing, misogynistic, objectifying, and abusive (towards women) porn being the accepted norm.

"I have a completely different perspective on this. When I first encountered anti-porn ideas around 2015-2017 (somewhere in there), it was through men promoting No Fap November to other men. I‚Äôm not on social media these days, so I don‚Äôt exactly have my finger on the pulse re: how No Fap has changed (the harvest testosterone to get money thing you mentioned), but I‚Äôd be hesitant to paint all No Fappers with such a broad brush as is seemingly used here. At the time I encountered anti-porn ideas, I was a regular consumer of porn, and I didn‚Äôt think there was anything wrong with it. I wasn‚Äôt one to call anti-porn ppl prude or support SW, but I was certainly pro-porn in the sense that I consumed it and thought it was fine. It was No Fap men who opened my eyes to the issues surrounding porn, and the conversation was far more involved than ‚Äúmy dick doesn‚Äôt work anymore.‚Äù They brought various victimization elements into my purview, and schooled me on the social and legal history of porn. I‚Äôm certainly no expert on that now, and it‚Äôs possible I would‚Äôve eventually encountered anti-porn ideas elsewhere, but I have to personally credit those men with initially introducing me to the concepts. 


There‚Äôs a large overlap bw No Fappers and right wing politics‚Äîor at least there was back when I first encountered it. I‚Äôd assume that‚Äôs still the case, but idk. A thought experiment I‚Äôd pose is whether or not the messenger is biasing the reception of the message.

"Yeah, I don't understand this. If you were to stare through a window at someone changing and jerk off to them, it would not only be seen as cheating in a relationship context, but also just be fucking creepy in general lol? The fact that we actually have the technology to allow men to do this discreetly, and that so many men today utilize it, doesn't make it any less disrespectful or creepy; it just means that they're showing their true colors and 99% of them just suck as human beings lol. (The coomer defense to this is usually that the porn actor ""consented"" to being used like this, but on the internet, how the hell do you actually know that? And in a relationship, what about the partner, did they consent to you essentially being in an open relationship with porn or are you hiding it from them?) 

Your post is spot on, I can't count the number of times I've seen condescending men on reddit compare porn to a vibrator, and it's just so intellectually dishonest and gaslighting to traumatized partners, not to mention disrespectful to the human beings in the content they're using. We already have an analogy to a vibrator, it's called a fleshlight. Porn is something categorically different!

It's funny, I've seen some relationship posts where some asshole gets caught jerking off to photos of a friend, coworker, etc and the partner is understandably horrified, and the responses are usually sympathetic to the partner, saying it's  cheating, something that will forever be burned in the partner's memory, and how they royally fucked up and that this is breakup territory, etc etc. But change that to ""regular"" free porn of strangers, and suddenly the responses do a total 180, telling the partner that the pornbrain is entitled to their privacy, banning porn is controlling, they're just insecure, etc. Like, what the fuck? It's literally the same exact behavior, but you change it from a known person to a stranger and suddenly they cease to be a human being and it ceases to be infidelity? It makes no sense.

"I see them as people, that's why I feel it's cheating. I define cheating as purposely seeking out sexual experiences with other people, knowing I don't agree with that. Then they lie, sneak, hide, protect and defend their access to it. Gaslight me and lie to my face when I discover the evidence. It's basically an affair but with people they're accessing sexually through a screen. It feels no different to cheating. The betrayal trauma to partners feels the same. The brain chemicals that bond you feel the same. You even hear guys reminiscing about being 10 jerking it to certain pornstars or when they've met actual pornstars and they remember them for life as if they're an ex partner they've slept with thousands of times. They're in love with them, they've explored their entire body, watched their sex moves, watched their their sex faces, seen every pov of them being penetrated. Associated orgasms to that person.

The other day, I was thinking about how poisoned young men's brains are by porn.

The players had to try to make a woman orgasm in her sleep without waking her, and it wasn't framed as assault. Insane to think about now, but I reckon the players of that game probably didn't see it as assault either, much like how these young boys and men run around raping women and don't even realise it. It's not just porn, but this weird taught idea that women actually want these acts, even if we say we don't.

When I was in my early 20s, my friend's housemate pulled my from a bed in the middle of the night, while I was drunk, and raped me. I came to in the middle and cried and begged him to stop. He thought I was crying because I had a boyfriend and I was ""cheating"", not because I was being raped. I don't think he thinks he did wrong even to this day.

"In my experience with men, I would say you‚Äôre correct; porn seems to amplify whatever (if any) urge for sexual violence that lies within a person.

When people (men especially) watch pornography, they tend to have this fantasy of ‚Äúdomination‚Äù and ‚Äúownership‚Äù due to the nature of (most) ‚Äúmade-for-men pornography‚Äù.

It‚Äôs actually interesting to discover how much of our current sexuality has been influenced by pornography.

For example: ‚ÄúCuck culture‚Äù. 

Sure, according to the books, cucking has been around for a while, but in today‚Äôs world, it‚Äôs just about someone dominating your wife in the most humiliating ways possible.

I have no doubt that the only reason any of the participants enjoy the act is due to their consumption of porn.

I say this, due to the obvious difference between what women and men who don‚Äôt watch porn enjoy during sex, and what women and men who do watch porn enjoys during sex.

I regret making any unfair generalizations here, but in my experience; women and men who indulge in pornography seem to have far more violent and performative urges/interests/kinks/fetishes than those who don‚Äôt.

If I had to make a guess, porn is the sole reason that sex has evolved from a pure action of love, to a shameful and disgusting act that‚Äôs (at times) unenjoyable.",l414xkx,PornIsMisogyny,1715707785.0

"If they fantasize about being the rescuer, they'll want to be rewarded with sex. There's an erotic charge associated with heroes and damsel in distress, for both sides of the equation.

Yeah, I remember having these sorts of daydreams and other as a teenager. They are widespread like this because of the media and cautionary tales we hear since toddlers. When the ""roman empire"" meme exploded, I thought to myself how sad it was that I spend my youth rehearsing how to act in the case of sexual assault. When I was way younger I fantasized about a random good guy that would intervene. And I'm actually pretty sure a lot of boys fantasize about being the rescuer.

To have girls and women fantasizing about a protector is important for the patriarchy, for 2 reasons:

* It makes women more likely to stand by waiting for help instead of acting on their own
* It reinforces the neat division between ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" and keeps us hooked on the idea of a selfless man who is invested in women's safety

As time passed, I started daydreaming about having some sort of nearby tool I could hit them with or punching them where it hurts. I also daydreamed about intervening in another woman's assault. It takes the heterosexual erotic charge out of the daydream. I was no longer waiting for a man to come bestow human recognition over me, no longer hooked on the idea of a man with big-brother good-guy energy. Eventually I just stopped daydreaming.

If you keep women in fear of ""bad guys"", they will be that much more dependent on the ""good guy"" who ""rescues her"" from them.

Dworkin has written about this topic in a variety of ways, here's an excerpt from *Right Wing Women* that hits on a similar theme:

>The political Right in the United States today makes certain metaphysical and material promises to women that both exploit and quiet some of women‚Äôs deepest fears. These fears originate in the perception that male violence against women is uncontrollable and unpredictable. Dependent on and subservient to men, women are always subject to this violence. The Right promises to put enforceable restraints on male aggression, thus simplifying survival for women‚Äîto make the world slightly more habitable, in other words‚Äîby offering the following:  
\[...\]  
*Safety*. For women, the world is a very dangerous place. One wrong move, even an unintentional smile, can bring disaster‚Äîassault, shame, disgrace. The Right acknowledges the reality of danger, the validity of fear. The Right then manipulates the fear. The promise is that if a woman is obedient, harm will not befall her.  
\[...\]  
The Right, very considerately, tells women the rules of the game on which their lives depend. The Right also promises that, despite their absolute sovereignty, men too will follow specified rules.  
\[...\]  
The Right in the United States today is a social and political movement controlled almost totally by men but built largely on the fear and ignorance of women. The quality of this fear and the pervasiveness of this ignorance are consequences of male sexual domination over women. Every accommodation that women make to this domination, however apparently stupid, self-defeating, or dangerous, is rooted in the urgent need to survive somehow on male terms. Inevitably this causes women to take the rage and contempt they feel for the men who actually abuse them, those close to them, and project it onto others, those far away, foreign, or different.

She also discusses throughout this section how the men most likely to harm a woman are the men directly surrounding her (family and friends), but that's *rarely* the men we're taught to fear. It's much more likely for a woman to be raped by a friend/family member than a random stranger on the street- but that's not the type of fear that keeps us in line, so it's not discussed. 

>And then I found myself thinking of just how many men watch porn and get off to that scenario. I fantasize about being rescued in that situation, but most men don‚Äôt fantasize about being the rescuer‚Äîthey fantasize about being the tormentor.

Truth is, whether they are fantasizing about tormenting OR rescuing, they don't care about women. Men fantasize about gaining power and control- either through force (rape) or coercion (the promise of safety).",llnye5h,PornIsMisogyny,1725559493.0

"It's really so bad that strangulation is far more likely to occur among the young in hetero hookups than *any* forms of clitoral stimulation. It's seen as a default, main act, especially during piv, and even more so during pia, whereas genital-genital rubbing, cunnilingus, non-vaginal manual on her, let alone tribadism like thigh riding, bum humping, ranges from optional extra/foreplay to only done if she insists to something she doesn't feel free to even ask for to really kinky and weird to impossible, unthinkable, by both sexes. (Don't get me started on the erasure of clit/vulva-centric (het) sex, especially hetero tribadism. Not only is it not sex, it isn't possible at all with a man. Supposedly.)

A major time I think ""get me off this planet"" is this mainstreaming of men and boys strangling, women and girls being strangled. This and other things are undoubtedly getting worse.

We are going to be dealing with much of a generation of girls and young women being brain damaged, and being brain damaged by boys and men. And that's the best case scenario from the supposedly ""safe way"" of strangling. (There's no safe way obviously.) It induces cerebral hypoxia at least, which leads to significant lasting brain damage, when severe and/or done repeatedly. And that's not counting the plethora of less common and other issues eg ability to even think worsened (and how that will impact academic achievement, careers...) to stroke, it's link to depression and anxiety.

Seriously, millions of people, esp the under 30s, can easily think of extreme maledom and sadism like strangulation but vulva/clit-centric sex, or even clit/vulva-inclusive sex is even more impossible to them than older people, young people in the 90s-00s. eg more faking, less orgasms, less cunnilingus, genital-genital rubbing manual, more fellatio, far more pia, a lot more male sadism, maledom, female submission... and in more ways and usually more extreme, much much more strangulation and other asphyxia, and astronomically more men strangling women. (97-99% of those into being strangled/asphyxiated used to be men and adolescent boys. Now in partnered encounters, women are overwhelmingly the strangled, men the stranglers, and autoerotic asphyxia remains overwhelmingly male.) Things like strangulation, ddlg, CNC, very violently performed (to her, by him) sex acts, are seen as mainstream, vanilla. 

Remember when most boys and men wanted women *to feel good*, to not be in pain with them, to want to have (more) sex with them...? They did often have wonky ideas about what felt good, how women orgasmed. Eg that women orgasmed from their vaginas, not clitoris, from piv due to religion, sex talks from parents and other boys, typically small amounts of generally softcore porn. Eg girls have a vagina, not clitoris/vulva, boys a penis, girls have sex with their vagina, boys their penis, sex is when he puts his penis in her vagina and thrusts until he ejaculates. This is standard sex ed, sex talk, our definition of sex, genitals, even now. 

And they were often teachable, eager to learn and be shown. (I actually found many teen boys, the non-jocks eg smart, music, drama..., to be receptive to feminism, piv critique, vulva-centric sex when I was in school in the 2000s pre-tubesite porm.) The main divide in men was between the piv-centric, lack of interest in clitoris/vulval stimulation vs the interested in varied stimulation, less narrowly/specifically sexual. Now it's like the piv-centric vs otherwise phallocentric, piv in certain positions, not that rough vs bdsm, and we're supposed to think we're lucky to get the former, that that's as good as it gets.

It was not nearly as bad as this eg thinking strangulation plus jackhammer piv, pia is the ticket to even her orgasms, if they mattered at all. I even remember years ago boys more often not wanting to strangle, wondering if it was expected of them, worried about it, etc in these anecdotes vs now finding it appealing, wanting to do it, where it's just... normal. ""Of course you'd want to do that to her too; it's part of sex. Sex means you can and should do whatever you want to her, anything that porn said you can do, that it told you you would want to do and should do if you are a real man."" Maybe with a caveat of doing it ""safely"" (meaning not quite as dangerously). But they've utterly grown up or are still going through maturation (physical, emotional, sexual) on tubesite/internet porn nowadays ie no censorship, a free-for-all for pimps and sadists.

Most mf internet tubesite porn doesn't depict female orgasm at all, unlike most mf porn before then, and when it does, it's overwhelmingly from piv or pia. There's very little partnered clitoral/vulval stimulation in mf porn at all, and most has none. And we know most of this is now coming from porn, including the massive rise in hetero pia (& a big rise in mm pia), fellatio being turned into ""deep throat"" at best. It's been set up by religion, piv as the definition of sex and what flows from that eg other phallocentricism, ""benevolent"" ""mild"" maledom and female submission, woman as helpmeet including in sex. Male arousal, desire, pleasure, orgasm as mandatory to sex, to it even being possible, and female an optional extra at best. Eroticizing men subjecting women to reproductive/unique and disproportionate risk and harm (eg ""be fruitful and multiply,"" mandating piv, forbidding non-piv sex and even withdrawal, erasing and denying vulva-centric sex...). But it's mostly now spread through porn (and sexology before that), and the specifics are often explicitly shown there, over and over, tied to usually arousal and often orgasm, mostly to almost exclusively eg strangulation. That they are just part of sex, foreplay, the sexual dynamics, interplay between the sexes. 

That it backs up what religion says, what we're told sex is, is why it speaks to us, why we see it as sexy, sex, when it looks as it does. It's why it looks as it does. And when other mediums, culture picks up on things, it's originally or at least most clearly, explicitly, largely from porn. (Religion has waned in influence hugely over the last couple centuries, hence sexology originally picking up the slack, and we have lots of atheists, alternative religions..., but porn still has that pull, that appeal, speaks to them, including to those not swayed by Abrahamic religions, or swayed by any religions...)

(Much of this is gleaned from Debby Herbenick's studies, some from Peggy Orenstein's Girls and Sex and Boys and Sex.

"haha i wrote this comment today in a sub about a reality tv show (Love Is Blind), i‚Äôm gonna copy it here because i think it really resonates with yours:

¬´ disagree. love can often very much be blind and sexual attraction can very much develop from loving that person even if initially we didn‚Äôt find them physically attractive/¬´¬†our type¬†¬ª (i hate this expression but using it because it‚Äôs used all the time here). you are unable to fathom this concept because the only cues your dick responds to is attraction to physical attributes.

don‚Äôt assume everyone‚Äôs sexual attraction is seldom linked to that because it‚Äôs not the case. for many persons (women much more likely), sexual attraction comes from personality attributes, unique things about the person such as mannerisms that we find cute/sexy, being turned on by how their mind works or by how kindly they treat people etc. i know that‚Äôs how it is for me. it‚Äôs about wanting to have sex with a person not just a body.

so love and attraction can totally be blind; i know it is in my case. and what ends up happening is that someone that i wasn‚Äôt initially attracted to physically, like that didn‚Äôt give me any visceral feeling of ¬´¬†damn they‚Äôre good looking¬†¬ª ‚Äì  actually becomes the most attractive PHYSICALLY once i am sexually attracted to who they are. i‚Äôm attracted to the body because i‚Äôm sexually attracted to the person and everything that they are. ¬ª",lksa3gk,PornIsMisogyny,1725077902.0

They also whine about ""puritanical"" authors who don't write kink or who push back against stories portraying incest, stepfather/stepchild, DDLG, A/B/O, etc. Even more disturbing is that most of the users on there sound like they're teenagers.",lcnkelg,PornIsMisogyny,1720693973.0

It took me rejecting 60+ men to find that again and even then I made him wait months to be sure. If I even so much as get sleepy and I'm not 100% engaged he picks me up and tucks me into bed, it's literally the bare minimum but I know it's rare nowadays. 

He also never gets horny for other women, when I was too sad to have sex a while ago and accidentally teased him he went into the bathroom with a picture of me in a bikini open on his phone.

We also statistically are homeless or impoverished more than a lot of other groups, and end up being forced to rely on porn or other sex work to make ends meet.

It's nice to have diversity in this space for other perspectives, insight, and to show any people drifting in this space that it's not made up of ONLY conservative religious people, which, most anti porn spaces often are and the bigotry or general negative tendencies are openly shown.

That puts anyone casually just looking to learn or understand the anti porn reasoning off and makes them dismiss it as just religious kooks being themselves as usual.

Loving someone means wanting the best for them. It means at times putting your own desires aside to help them achieve theirs. Love is lifting up your mate, ensuring that they never feel insecure or like they have to make themselves uncomfortable to satisfy you. 

I do not know where the idea came from that loving someone is about reducing your personhood for them, or self harming, or allowing them to harm you. 

What I do know is that if you can only be aroused by causing harm or distress to someone else, or if you insist on someone harming you even when they are repulsed or afraid of the idea, you‚Äôre simply a terrible person and you should not be in a relationship until you‚Äôve done the work you need to do on yourself to be better.",llvfrm4,PornIsMisogyny,1725663854.0

"The reason porn use is normalized within monogamous relationships is due to the overall normalization of non-monogamous behaviors in general.

Think about it: How many non-monogamous behaviors have you seen people be gaslight into thinking are ‚Äúnormal‚Äù on Reddit? Personally, i‚Äôve seen quite a few.

An example of some of these behaviors are the following:

Crushing on others (celeb or not)

Fantasizing about others (celeb or not)

Lusting after others (goes along with the other two)

Pornography use (even when not escalated to addiction)

These behaviors are not only normalized, but deemed healthy by the VAST majority of people in this world.

The population has been brain-washed into thinking that it‚Äôs normal to be aroused and lust after anyone they think is beautiful, and that stems from the normalized of sexualizaiton and (therefore) objectification (which is the root of the porn industry).

 In reality, most people should be able to find others ‚Äúattractive‚Äù, yet only be ‚Äúattracted‚Äù to their partner. Yet if you expect that (totally reasonable) behavior from your partner, you‚Äôre deemed a child who lives in a fantasy land.

I‚Äôve been married for over 20 years now, and I haven‚Äôt once been turned on or fantasized about or crushed on anyone but my wife (including celebrities).

This isn‚Äôt because i‚Äôm demisexual either, it‚Äôs because I haven‚Äôt trained my mind to automatically sexualize people.

"From my experience having dated a serious porn addict & another porn user, my theory is the following. They get off from porn from a young age and that's their default sexual experience. Watching porn, they don't learn to associate love/connection with sex. The content itself is far from loving. So when they meet a person they form an emotional connection with, they don't want to have sex with them. The porn addict told me ''I don't want to have sex with you BECAUSE I love you'' - as in, he can get off on brutal objectification, but he sees me as a person, and doesn't want to do that with/to me. It's some sort of next-level Madonna/Whore complex playing out. Secondly, sex is about connection. Watching porn is (often) an addiction, and addicts get their hits because they want to ESCAPE the present moment and dissociate - the opposite of connection. Some people watch porn for this escaping reason. I think that's the 'why'. It has nothing to do with intimacy or love, so they can happily watch it while having a real person in another room - no matter how beautiful and interested that person might be. Many are completely out of touch with their bodies, so it's no surprise they have no idea how to handle being intimate with another person in an erotic/seductive way. It's tragic.

"I really don't get it either. Sexuality is so shaped by what you see during puberty, and children as young as eight are being exposed to porn. So I think for a lot of men, their sexuality = porn. This happens to women too to an extent, but it's somewhat mitigated by being exposed to porn later, not watching it as much etc. 

I don't think it's something I'll fully understand, though I'm trying to. Back when I used porn myself before stopping, it was something I did once every few months. And when I was in a relationship, I touched it even less because I only had eyes for my partner - I was so attracted to them I couldn't even look at other men, let alone pixelated ones. But men for some reason will watch it four times a week even while having a girlfriend, and actually struggle to stop watching of they're asked to give it up. Once I learnt about the exploitation in the industry and how it blocks intimacy in relationships it was the easiest thing for me to stop. And additionally, finding out my partner used porn really plummeted my attraction for them. It felt like cheating.

"All I can do is tell you my experience and what age and a shitload of therapy has taught me. 

I‚Äôm 45. I was exposed to my dad‚Äôs magazine porn at 4 or 5. I was fascinated immediately. I remember when I was really little-8 or so my parents both had 40th birthday parties and had strippers. They had ushered the kids upstairs and told us to not come out, but we weren‚Äôt supervised and we watched from upstairs. There were plenty of pictures that were just in the regular picture box with all the family pics that I looked at. I was hyper sexual by 7, was first sexually assaulted by and older family friend (15m) when I was 10. He tried to have sex with me, told me I was too tight, and I remember feeling so ashamed and embarrassed and like I wasn‚Äôt good enough. He ended up just having me give him a blowjob, but again told me I‚Äôd done it wrong and I felt like a failure. At the time I felt like I was consenting to all of it. I was excited and wanted to. I thought he was going to be my boyfriend. I didn‚Äôt realize what had actually happened until at 35 I was in therapy for some other trauma, and was bringing it up as my first sexual experience, and my therapist tried to gently tell me that was assault, that I couldn‚Äôt have consented to it. I was angry with her about it.  Then the next day I got a FB memory of my own child at the age of 10, and as I looked at them, I felt so sick. They were so small, just a kid. Nothing sexual about a 10 year old. So I went and found an old picture of myself at 10 and felt even sicker. 

I was assaulted and raped repeatedly from 10-20. I had all sorts of excuses for why it had happened.  I had led them on, I didn‚Äôt say no enough, I didn‚Äôt say no, but cried the whole time but that wasn‚Äôt his fault he didn‚Äôt know if I didn‚Äôt say no, right?  And on and on. My entire worth was tied up in my sexuality, I tried to find love and safety and acceptance through sleeping which everyone, being as sexy as possible, being desired by everyone. 

I don‚Äôt watch a lot of porn, but I did watch it. The regret I have is immense. I‚Äôve always been really liberal and I believed what everyone told me. I didn‚Äôt want to shame people for their sexuality. I had been harassed throughout high school for being bi, and I think that went into it. I ended up married to a porn addict. After 25 years together, he‚Äôs destroyed me. I have no self confidence, I‚Äôm depressed, su*cidal, hate my body, and have anxieties about how I‚Äôm aging. I‚Äôve been clinically diagnosed with PTSD and CPTSD. 

The messaging that society gives us about what women are for is everywhere. Porn exposure addles men‚Äôs brains to see every woman as an object, and porn exposure by women addles their brains to objectify and sexualize ourselves and other women. I‚Äôm not making excuses for myself-but it‚Äôs hard to detach from that messaging when it‚Äôs a non-stop constant onslaught of sexualization of women and minorities around every corner.  Men are lauded for their achievements, women are lauded for their physical appearance. 

I desperately wanted attention and love coming from a childhood of abuse and neglect. Sex seemed to be the natural way to find it. 

Again, no excuses here. I‚Äôm so fucking sorry about how I contributed to this horrible mess we‚Äôre in now. I‚Äôm so fucking sad that kids are being groomed by compete access to this shit from such a young age. I‚Äôm just so fucking sad. 

I‚Äôm sorry about your experiences. I know how damaging and confusing and awful it is. Not keeping porn from kids is out and about abuse. It‚Äôs grooming. It‚Äôs as bad as letting them have open access to drugs or alcohol. It‚Äôs not ok. I hope you can find healing and peace in your future. üíú",l1jvb8n,PornIsMisogyny,1714251167.0

I stopped watching porn because porn became more violent and more gross with time, I couldn lie to myself anymore the things in porn looked too violent( actually were kinda tame compared to what I hear  is know hardcore porn) and also, I started to learn about radical feminism, stopped self harming through hypersexuality

1. It‚Äôs accessible. Anyone with a device and connection to the internet can find porn. 
2. It‚Äôs anonymous. They can do it in private, and wipe their history clean. No more walking into a video store to rent a movie, or buying a magazine from a store. No need to give anyone your address to have things posted, or even your phone number or email address. No one has to know you even saw it, so there‚Äôs no shame or accountability, and if you‚Äôre careful, no real fear of being found out.  
3. It‚Äôs largely free. Sure there‚Äôs paid content, but most of it is stolen these days and shared or uploaded elsewhere, and there‚Äôs *so very much* free content that if an 18 year old sat down on the morning of their birthday and watched porn for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for the rest of their life, they would never run out of new, free material. 
4. No one ever physically overdosed on porn. No one could not just watch one more clip or see one more nude. No one ever blacked out or needed their stomach pumped or got taken to hospital for treatment for overdosing on porn. While we know the brain damage it causes, medical authorities are hesitant to classify it as addictive or a treatable mental or psychological/psychiatric condition. Why? Because gatekeepers to the DSM5 and politicians are mostly men.

Imagine being able to drink as much as you want for 8 hours straight and not be too affected to drive, or work? Imagine smoking crack for seven hours a day while your partner is at work and having no visible ill effects or damage?

Even with gambling, another non-substance based addiction, there‚Äôs measurable loss - the monetary effects of gambling are unavoidable. There‚Äôs none of that with porn (unless you‚Äôre escalated enough to be deep into buying it).

In contrast, just clicking on the women‚Äôs SECTION (not even a specific item/product line) gives you a slew of full body shots of women in revealing swimwear. Because women are the product.

The deliberate gap between revealing and concealing of images is done so these men can feel they don‚Äôt have to live up to any standards for women while perving to the max. And to try and fool women into thinking/feeling pressure to perform as a piece of flesh throughout their life.",llyoi2z,PornIsMisogyny,1725721078.0

"This is what is commonly called ""rape myths""- i.e. prejudicial,¬†stereotyped, and false beliefs about¬†sexual assaults, rapists, and rape victims. They often serve to excuse sexual aggression, create hostility toward victims, and bias criminal prosecution. Rape myths are created by men to protect rapists and those who fantasize about rape (future rapists).

Rape myths thrive in porn, that's where the myth is developed and deeply embedded into the mind of the consumer. Things like, ""She invited him over after 10pm,"" ""She knew what she was doing wearing that,"" and ""No one held a gun to her head, she must've wanted it or she would've left."" Repeatedly consuming and orgasming to the type of scenario you described teaches the viewer that women are fine with trading their bodies for material goods. She eventually 'comes around' and acts like she likes it, therefore all women must secretly enjoy coercive consent, right? She's crying, but she's also *acting* like she's orgasming, so all women must enjoy pain in bed, right?

Men see us as sex objects, in their fantasies we are wanton and waiting/looking for these types of scenarios. That's why men think it's fine to immediately sexualize a woman upon meeting her- catcalling, aggressive 'flirting' with strangers, harassment, SA, ect. You're right, they enjoy our pain. They enjoy it because they think women are meant to be in pain- our pain is a feature ('this one comes with the crying during sex setting') not a bug.

I think that's why ""normal men"" are ""confused"" about consent. They aren't confused. They believe rape myths- they LOVE rape myths. Believing that 'she wanted it' is an integral part of their porn consumption- they have to believe it, or they'd have to self-reflect about what they're watching. Because most men watch porn more often than they have real sex with a consenting woman, they're repeatedly reinforcing and externalizing the myths until it impacts how they see every woman they meet. It's willful ignorance, and it's very convenient for them.",llsla5a,PornIsMisogyny,1725630234.0
"To this day I can't believe so many women's naivety in believing that their partner who watches pretend-rape videos won't be turned on if they accidentally hurt her during sex. These men are not the ones feeling the pain and violation, so their brains have no reason to draw a line between fantasy and reality regarding the acts themselves. What stops them are the *consequences*, but they are still men who get turned on at women getting hurt.

The problem with porn is that it *normalizes* what should be alarming fantasies. When the websites you know every other men around you is likely to also visit are full of coerced rape, you subliminally convince yourself that it's but normal to get turned on at this.",llsrx45,PornIsMisogyny,1725632531.0

Back when i was in HS, there'd always be these shock sites and scenes that would do round around the area, because of the above. One such scene is from a woman, who passed away in 2021 in a car accident i believe. The story behind the scene, as disclosed in an AMA she did her years later, was that she had a gambling problem and lost a lot of money in Las Vegas.

It takes 2 seconds of empathy to put themselves in women's shoes. They are willfully ignorant because, to them, their desires > women's comfort.

"I was reminded of an interaction I had some years ago when I was doing porn. I was talking to a guy that owns a very prominent men's issues page on Instagram (originally it was pretty good, i liked it, then the guy went anti-feminist and his shit took a nosedive).

I was having a conversation to him about feminism, patriarchy and how it affects men. Very normal conversation. He knew my line of work, I primarily advertised on Instagram, but it never came up in this instance. 

After our conversation came to a natural conclusion he said ""also, fantastic boobs as per usual üëå,"". At the time I brushed it off, I was young, repressing my trauma and loving any kind of male attention. 

But I saw the screenshot today and I thought... Jesus. Even outside of the context of sex work, sex workers are treated like objects.

Also I was 19 and he was well into his 30s, so that definitely didn't help. 

He never bought from me. Just oggled my Instagram. This wasn't the first or only such comment he made but I was too brainwashed to think anything of it. 

The first time I felt like I was truly seen as a person who is (was) a sex worker, and not just a sex worker, was when I came across anti-sex work feminists. My buyers were primarily leftist men, I mixed my politics into my work and that ended up being my audience.

"All of it is tainted somehow. Just from a physiological perspective when porn is shot that these people exist in a space and can immediately go into it. There is no foreplay which a lot of good sexual tension that falls under foreplay has nothing to do with genital contact or clothes being removed. Women tend to need well more than just a guy existing and they're ready for penetration but porn creates a fake narrative that things work like that. It's all around when he's ready (hard) not her. I know that's been talked about for a while, but the culture didn't work on building chemistry or attraction. It just advocated lube as common use.

All penetration is aggressive and some positions may be down right subjugated. The uptrend on spitting is intended to humiliate often.

Edit to add: porn creates a scenario and a narrative without consent existing and this has happened in most encounters.

Piv, to the point the expectation that the woman should orgasm just from PIV alone, no foreplay no nothing, and that only PIV counts as sex.

Zero clitoral stimulation since most women in porn get their clit hidden cuz it doesnt looks aesthethic.


Sex as a performance, if a guy says things like ""i prefer women who know what they re doing in bed"" or ""inexperienced women suck cuz they re bad a sex"" huge redflag for porn consumption there, treating sex as a performance where the woman is judged based on how well she performs denotes a porn brained individual.


Heres the thing, im a male, i have never consumed porn, i have always found it distasteful, both me and my girlfriend lost our virginities together, she orgasmed (NOT FROM PIV).

tbh i find it incredibly concerning that most men DON'T find it more vulnerable and intimate. like we are near your genitals with our teeth! we could literally dismember you!!! imo the trust in that is what is supposed to make bjs so fun, sexy and romantic.

"There‚Äôs lots of talk about a ‚Äòmale loneliness epidemic‚Äô, particularly in young men. 

They don‚Äôt seem to understand it‚Äôs because of the way they treat women. 

They bond over the sexualisation of women and girls, trade nudes, watch and talk about porn, all of which is baseless and lacks any human connection. So their interactions with women are about dehumanising us, and their interactions with men are about which of them more successfully/brutally/hilariously dehumanised us. 

Is it any wonder they‚Äôre lonely? They have no real connections with others. 

No generation came with a smooth path to understanding and making work male/female relationships. When my parents and grandparents were teens, boys were just as mystified by girls as they are now, and girls were curiously careful and keen for the attention of boys exactly as it is today. 

Relationships were harder in older generations, because it was harder to leave if something went wrong. Perhaps our mistake has been in making divorce easier and relationships less valuable, instead of making the path to marriage and cohabitation harder, and having severe consequences for abuse. 

I was taking about this at work just this week. We have to build the society we want, and what we‚Äôve built is cheap, accessible, disposable, valueless, and meaningless relationships that leave more and more adults and children broken than ever before in our history. 


The sexual revolution was fine in the hands of a generation who largely hasn‚Äôt had to live with the consequences of it. No strings attached sex, no-fault divorce, unenforceable child support, now we have 24 hour porn in your pocket and fake insta lifestyles, everyone is an expert on relationships and no one is. 

It‚Äôs low-accountability living, and it‚Äôs destroying the ability of people to make genuine, respectful, reciprocal connections. 

If young men want to cure their ‚Äòloneliness epidemic‚Äô the first thing they must do is quit porn. The opposite of loneliness is connection, and porn is parasocial. Getting to know real women from all walks of life in all its delightful awkwardness in your youth is its own reward. It‚Äôs how each generation sorts through and learns to understand their attractions and revulsions, their tolerances, their desires. Having an unfulfillable fantasy projected at you anytime you‚Äôre bored or horny just hinders your progress from adolescent to adulthood. You can‚Äôt know what you genuinely desire until you‚Äôre with someone and living it. 

How many people do you hear talk about watching really disgusting porn and saying they get off to it but wouldn‚Äôt want to actually do it in real life? Too many. That‚Äôs hijacking your desires, your arousal template, destroying your natural pathways for attraction. Who would knowingly want to do that? There‚Äôs no suspense or anticipation of genuine arousal and growing interest in building connection, because it‚Äôs been derailed by the expectations of fantasy, so there‚Äôs no genuine joy or pleasure in connecting. It‚Äôs just masturbating using someone else‚Äôs body. 

When you‚Äôre porn free, the anticipation of each sweet step in the getting-to-know-you process when you meet someone new is so intoxicating. The joy that comes from building that connection as you get to know and trust each other over time is even more pleasurable. Intimate sex with someone you know is infinitely better than the distracting novelty of watching an endless supply of new and different bodies that you‚Äôll never actually meet or touch.

Same with the other commenter talking about it only becoming a problem when you boil everything down to just their boobs... under a post where the whole focus is on JUST THEIR BOOBS.

"I have so many questions to this nonsense.

1. In what WAY is being anti-porn used against queer people? To my knowledge, it‚Äòs porn that is extremely anti-LGBTQIA+ (for example: lesbian porn is made for the male gaze, or lesbians are turned ‚Äöstraight‚Äò by literally getting raped by men). 

2. Keeping porn legal will make it easier to access. Easier access means that people, especially children, will be indoctrinated with the idea that women are sexual objects that should be used, dehumanized and degraded. How in the world is this a good thing?

3. What really is protecting pornstars from being exploited is fighting the industry as a whole. You cannot tell me that 99.9% of all porn stars absolutely love their career and love that this dehumanizing degrading shit of them is on the Internet. You can‚Äòt tell me that they didn‚Äòt regret that it‚Äòs posted online 10 years later. And also: You can punish people for consuming it instead of punishing the person that is exploited? Nordic model is actually a solution to this. 

4. ahh the old good ‚Äûthere are some people that like doing it!!‚Äú ->What percentage of all sex workers love to do their ‚Äûjob‚Äú? And are there any sex workers who aren‚Äòt absolutely traumatized by the industry they got into? I cannot imagine that being in such an environment won‚Äòt leave you traumatized. And people being desperate enough to sell away their consent means we have to change the capitalistic system that makes a woman ‚Äûchoose‚Äú between starving and selling away her consent, being unprotected against rapists, STDs or pimps that steal her money. We have to change the economic system (preferably socialism) in order to minimize the number of people who go into sex work due to a financial crisis.

5. Yes sex work is demeaning? Men being able to buy access to a woman‚Äòs body is the purest form of patriarchy. Why don‚Äòt you see rich old white men that are billionaires selling themselves in the red light district? Because it‚Äòs a fucking degrading and traumatizing thing to do.",lh38vdg,PornIsMisogyny,1723115829.0
"When porn is legal, porn actress are not protected from being rejected from any other job. The porn itself is still dangerous to film, what is filmed is still abusive and it doesn't stop the actress from becoming addicted as a way to cope. The industry still prey on young and naive/vulnerable women then ditch them in a pit. You're still not protected from STIs and bound by the rule of demand for the type of content you have to make. Your videos still get stolen, making you less money. Men still don't respect you and will share all your content for free if they want to just to pass you off. IA porn might still be made from your face and body. You still make little to no money if you're not famous and being famous doesn't last.

Third comparing any sex work to regular jobs is flawed, we can see it from Germany making refusing sex work an exception to losing unemployment benefits, if it was the same as any other job that wouldn't be needed.

"Sex and 'fucking' are once again something you do TO a woman, which degrades, demeans and denigrates her.

Makes sense why they act like a woman who's had sex with more than one dude is somehow 'ran through' or lesser than as a result of the cumulative sex.

Disgusting.

I've noticed this view transcends coomers and sexuality, as the average person in a lot of groups treats sex as a conquest and something you DO to someone as a gross ass display of dominance over them.

You'll see common language like the below

""I want to destroy him/her""

""I want to make him/her a wreck""

Etc when talking about sex, it's insanely infuriating that this is widespread and never spoken about how toxic and backwards it is, yet, all libs are screaming and reeing about SEX POSITIVITY.

"So I don‚Äôt know how well I can answer this because I‚Äôm lucky to have a good father who is anti-porn, anti-prostitution, and anti-sexualization. However, he did once tell me that he isn‚Äôt ‚Äúas worried‚Äù about me compared to my sister because I‚Äôm ‚Äúmore cautious and reasonable.‚Äù This doesn‚Äôt describe his attitude in general since he is usually protective of both of us and never victim blames, but it did make me think. I believe this world is dangerous for women, and that simply being cautious is not enough to protect you from getting hurt.

However, that idea must be scary for fathers who love their daughters. Knowing that nothing is protecting her from getting trafficked, coerced, sexualized, etc. So I think some fathers (again, not my own) cope with this by ‚Äúothering‚Äù porn stars and sex workers by assuming that they wanted it.

Hence why they don‚Äôt stop watching porn, because the moment they admit porn is wrong, the moment they have to admit that these women are victims too. And the moment they can admit that, the moment they realize that they can no longer have peace of mind by thinking, ‚ÄúOh, but it would never happen to MY daughter.‚Äù And that is a terrifying realization.",lbwtu6d,PornIsMisogyny,1720282941.0

"It‚Äôs not just porn; there have been a CRAZY amount of behaviors that are CLEARLY cheating or cheating-esk which have been normalized in monogamous relationships.

These include:

Porn 

Crushes (Celeb or not)

Sexual fantasies about others (celeb or not)

Constant appearance comparison 

Those are just a few; but they‚Äôre the most significant. Each one of those behaviors only seem ‚Äúnormal‚Äù or ‚Äúnatural‚Äù because the parties involved are open to indulging in them.

What I mean by that; is (generally) people are only  going to be tempted or have an urge to indulge in actions if they‚Äôve already opened their mind up to performing them.

This is why both porn and sexual fantasies about others (without porn) have been shown to increase the chance of infidelity. Sure those behaviors are not technically cheating, but they essentially train the neural pathways to be more open to the idea.

My own testimony with this phenomenon is that the fact that i‚Äôve been in situations where almost every man I knew would have either cheated (and have cheated) or at the very least been tempted.
