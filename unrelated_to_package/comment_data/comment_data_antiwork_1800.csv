"Never. The French view their politicians as employees they have chosen to run the government and if they do a poor job, they are going to be scolded and fired. 

Americans are pathologically afraid of our government and what it will take from us or impose upon us. We are worried about our freedoms, our money, our weapons, etc. We idolize our politicians and think of them as better than us, rather than just as ordinary people doing a job we hired them for.

EDIT: I will add that I'm not even referring to the MAGAists, in terms of idolizing politicians, although that cult of personality is pretty damn weird. I'm thinking more of the way we treat so many politicians as very removed from us, in some cases even as if they were royalty. JFK and his ""Camelot"" are close to the extreme of this, for the Left, but in general we don't treat many politicians as though they are just some of us who happened to get into office; there is a much greater divide. It might have something to do with the wealth disparity in this country, even though that is not always directly reflected in our politicians. 

I think this is some of the appeal of AOC – she seems like one of ""us"", a neighbor who just happened to sneak into ""their"" world.",lnykm0y,antiwork,1726784029.0

"The full section, because I know some people aren't gonna look it up (Emphasis mine):

Overtime Pay Threshold. Overtime pay is one of the most challenging aspects of the Fair Labor Standards Act rules. “Nonexempt workers” (e.g., workers whose job duties fall within the law’s power or whose total pay is low enough) must be paid overtime (150 percent of the “regular rate”) for every hour over 40 in a work-week. Overtime requirements may discourage employers from offering certain fringe benefits such as reimbursement for education, childcare, or even free meals because the benefits’ value may be included in the “regular rate” that must be paid at 150 percent for all overtime hours. And because some of these fringe benefits may be more valuable (and often come with tax preferences that benefit the worker), **the goal should be to set a threshold** to ensure lower-income workers have the protections of overtime pay without discouraging employers from offering these benefits.

**DOL should maintain an overtime threshold that does not punish businesses in lower-cost regions (e.g., the southeast United States).**

The Trump-era threshold is high enough to capture most line workers in lower-cost regions. One possibility to consider (likely requiring congressional action) would be to automatically update the thresholds every five years using the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) as an inflation adjustment. This could reduce the likelihood of a future Administration attempting to make significant changes but would also impose more adjustments on businesses as those automatic increases take hold.

Congress should clarify that the “regular rate” for overtime pay is based on the salary paid rather than all benefits provided. This would enable employers to offer additional benefits to employees without fear that those benefits would dramatically increase overtime pay.

**Congress should provide flexibility to employers and employees to calculate the overtime period over a longer number of weeks. Specifically, employers and employees should be able to set a two- or four- week period over which to calculate overtime.** This would give workers greater flexibility to work more hours in one week and fewer hours in the next and would not require the employer to pay them more for that same total number of hours of work during the entire period.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Basically, they want to set a threshold of how much overtime you can earn. That limit is obviously getting set as low as possible, not much to say on that, but the final part I bolded is especially concerning, because in practice they could easily cram 4 weeks worth of hours within a 2 or even 1 week time span and employees would get no overtime for being run ragged as long as they don't get any hours for the rest of the period. That's not to say they can't do this already on a smaller scale, but sleep deprivation get exponentially worse as time goes on.

Even if we were to hand wave the effects of these kinds of shifts by saying they'd get a week off for every nightmare week worked... the kinds of companies willing to skirt overtime to save a quick buck generally aren't paying their workers enough to live on, forcing their employees to get another job at another company doing the exact same thing to make ends meet.

Employees could work nightmare shifts at company A for 1 week to just barely miss overtime hours and get nothing else scheduled for next week, which frees up plenty of time for their nightmare shift week at company B! Amazing! Again, I'm pretty sure this is already done on a smaller scale for some people, but all extending the overtime calculation period does is make that waaaaaaay easier for scheduling managers to pull off so the idea is much more ""accessible"" for other companies. It's easier to schedule for someone who's technically available for 1 or 2 whole weeks than it is to build around individual days.

"10ish years ago, the stores I worked at eventually was budgeted at 110-120 hours per week labor.  The store was open 13 hours a day (8-9), 14 during holidays, 7 days a week.  The rule was you had to have two people closing (state required minimum 4 hour shift.)  Trucks were expected to be worked on 2-3 days a week starting at 6 am instead of 8 AM.

Let's do some math.  13x7=91 +1/2 hour per day for open or closing time (counting drawers, etc.) 3.5 hours + second person closing 4x7 = 28 plus the extra 2 hours x 2 days x3 employees to work truck = 12 hours.  Goodness, we are already up to 134.5 hours.  I guess the extra 14.5 hours will have to come out of a salaried employee.  Oh, that's me.  Now, who do I want to work alone for the 9 hours a day we don't have double coverage?  No one?  Ok, I guess that means I'm also working the 9 x7 = 63 hours it takes to have double coverage.  Add in the 14.5, and we have 77.5 hours a week I need to work to make sure there aren't hours at a time with only one employee in the store.

All for the lovely salary of around $35K per year.  And all before the first employee calls off or quits and no one is there to cover them.

Managers at Dollar General either work alone for about 16 hours a week, go over budget, or work every damn day.

And even doing this, they are being paid salary to work, not to manage.  Just try to get office time while managing a Dollar General, I dare you.

"Tip theft is illegal.

This happened to me once. I made $13/hr+tips running a food truck at a popular bar. Took home about $1300/week +cash between hourly/ot/ and electronic tips. I ran the food to people's tables so a lot of people gave me 20%. It was just me in the truck. So the boss fires me, says she'll give me the deposit in 2 weeks. I tell her no, you'll do it in 24 hours because that's texas law. She said thats not true and got condescending about me being a cook vs her being a business owner (2 pyramid schemes and a failing food truck all wasting her husbands money) and after exchanged insults  I sent her a screenshot of the TX law. The next day, I get a check for like, $300. I ask her where the fuck the rest of it is and she sends me a screenshot of TX ""tip credit law"" and  says something like ""this is a lesson to you about your attitude and thinking youre so smart, you're a cook not a business owner for a reason"" she told me tip credit meant she could pay me 5 an hour and only give me enough of the tips to make 7.25 and the business keeps the rest of the tips.  She admitted to 2 crimes through text.I demanded my owed money and the data from the register, for the entire time i worked there, and threw many more insults. Said if she didn't, I would call the state labor commission and the cops. Because wage theft is civil and criminal in texas.  After a condescending and directly insulting lesson from me on how tip credits work and changing pay rates were illegal. She said she would call her lawyer and have him call me to explain that she was right.

Why couldn’t he sell to the workers and aid in the creation of a co-operative?

“more than 70 of SecureIT’s 80 employees “on paper, were millionaires,” .. and then: Between the time of the acquisition [1998] and February 2000, VeriSign’s stock increased by more than 2,300%, closing at a high of $253 per share, helped by two stock splits and a temporary bubble for tech stocks. The bubble burst later that year, and VeriSign’s stock lost roughly 75% off that high point at the end of 2000, sinking to a low of nearly $4 in 2002.

So he sold, gave bonuses in the form of company stock, the stock crashed, and the workers were again left with no actual capital. The stock value returned later - but only if the workers held onto their stocks and weren’t forced to sell in the 20+ years in between the acquisition and the current, slightly lower value. 

The workers weren’t ever actually made millionaires. Only ‘on paper’ and their ability to become millionaires is questionable. If he had sold to the employees, their ability to have become wealthy would have been much higher, as their income would have been direct and not based on speculation. The claim they were “made millionaires” is entirely based on a market speculation for a specific time frame, and not over the life of the company afterwards. 

This is a thinly veiled whitewashing which represents corporate ownership as a net positive for employees, and doesn’t necessarily reflect the actual effects on their earnings or their lives.

Smaller class sizes and smaller course loads, so we have more time to assess and grade and address knowledge gaps and apply individualized instruction are the changes I feel would be most effective.

There is resistance in our culture to fixing problems rather than just throwing money at it. That resistance is exhibited in the field of education. I went through a unionization and pay was 95% of the conversation. Getting teachers to admit that workload is just as much a problem as pay is like pulling teeth.

Because if it’s one of those, then your Boss could legitimately just straight up be wrong because they are stupid - for example, Dayforce by default with the cheap version does 15 minute intervals, but then it rounds based on 7.5 minutes.

Edit:
Not that it’s ok for them to do it because it makes it easy on them I probably lost out on dozens of hours of pay from this as an intern


Edit: 

Wow this is my most blown up comment so far. Some more context: this company was a metal powder producer in rural PA. I don’t actually think that this practice is illegal but 100% immoral and should be illegal. If you clock in 5 mins early you should get paid for that 5 mins because you are at work and working. The whole system rounding thing being easy: I mean for managers helping people reach 40hrs a week. If you clock in and out frequently at odd times and say miss a day of work for unpaid leave it’s (ever so slightly) harder to figure out exactly when to clock in and out for the next week to make it up (yes it’s a like 1 min calculation but the software doesnt support this kind of thing so a manager would have to do this calculation themselves) you need 8hrs but can only work “9a-5p” but the system will round you off if you clock in a few mins early and a few mins late so the manager needs to determine when you can clock in and out to make sure your 40hrs don’t get affected by this rounding ….",l70zouh,antiwork,1717481416.0
"Back in the day of manual time cards, the kind you would pull out of the slot and insert into a time clock, and it would loudly stamp the time onto the card... those days, yes, often times employers would round time to the quarter-hour.

But, they had to do it fairly. ROUNDING to the NEAREST quarter-hour.

It was meant to make processing time cards and payroll easier and to reduce clerical mistakes that could potentially actually mess up hours more drastically.

It was done as a time saver, too, obviously. So if an employer processed their own time cards instead of having an HR employee handle the task, and was super cheap, they could take a little extra time to be sure they always rounded up or down in their favor. Yes, then that is absolutely wage theft. The rounding rule has to be applied fairly. 4:01 would become 4:00. 4:10 would become 4:15. 4:25 would become 4:30.

That was in the past. Nowadays, even the smallest employer can save even more money and time by having things more automated. And in that case, no rounding is necessary or beneficial. Computers make it unnecessary.

Remember, the practice was not designed to save money on labor hours - they should come out to be the same with rounding over time. So all it reduced was time to process payroll and errors made doing so.

Any employer that decides to save money by spending more time nowadays to go out of their way to always round in their favor is probably not making a lot of money and is spending their time focused on the small things, not trusting their staff and treating them well, and is generally maybe struggling at their business anyway.

And stealing. That's stealing. It's a fine line. Which is one reason why when computerized systems came along, it was advantageous to abandon the rounding practice -- it caused issues and questions even when it was done honestly and fairly, which could still hurt trust, cohesiveness, and as a result productivity and insider thefts, etc... better to be completely transparent with employees so there are no questions along those lines any more.",l71hfbt,antiwork,1717494011.0

Told my boss I wanted a $4 raise. $2 to match the other companies, and another $2 for the time I've been there plus the responsibilities I've taken on.

He said no.

His two reasons were A, the people I've talked to don't actually pay their employees that much/earn that much, and B, I didn't know how to do the new hire's job EVEN THOUGH I TRAINED HER REMOTELY WHILE DOING THE WORK OF TWO PEOPLE

"I used to get so mad, back in my navy days (I retired at the end of 2009). I was single for my first 16 years of service. There were so many considerations and special deals given to the married guys, it would leave me disgusted. During deployments, the married guys even got ""family separation allowance,"" an extra pay. 

For the junior guys who were stuck living in the (shitty) barracks, watching the married guys move to an apartment or house in town, and get extra pay for being married, became extra infuriating.

A few years before I retired, investigations started across all branches of the military over ""fraudulent marriages."" Marriages were considered fraudulent when the couple only got married so they could take advantage of the extra pay and benefits of being married. They usually didn't live together, and were just friends, who would then divorce when the advantages of being married were no longer advantageous. I knew a few people who enjoyed the benefits of these marriages of convenience.

The DoD considered getting married for the extra pay and benefits as fraudulent, but historically, is it really? Maybe the better solution would be to not incentivize marriage.

Sailor: Hey chief, can I take off a little early today? My car is at the shop, and I'd like to pick it up before they close.

"Where I grew up, I don't think people ever thought that they would get rich from work. They were simply convinced that it was their role in life. There was an almost Huxleyan control over how they perceived themselves and their social class.

The great success of the elite is not to disguise their wealth or sell mythology to the public (although they do both of these effectively as well). It is to convince people to be acquiescent with the status quo, and to effectively gatekeep the upper echelons of the class and socio-economic structure.

Huxley described this as ""a method of control by which a people can be made to enjoy a state of affairs by which any decent standard they ought not to enjoy...the enjoyment of servitude"". In *Brave New World*, it is depicted that the population not merely accepts, but expects to be part of the social class to which they've been assigned. They are even somewhat hostile to the idea of climbing the ranks, while also looking down on those below them to a certain extent. 

I have found this to be a consistently accurate representation of how society actually operates, and it was especially prevalent in the attitudes of adults when I was growing up. As a reflection of this, all of the values that I were taught were about accepting your place, responsibilities, and duties.

This may be somewhat different in the US or other countries, but I doubt that it is. However, I can say that the class system is highly ingrained in the UK, so it may be particularly entrenched in our society.",l0vtp2l,antiwork,1713877464.0

Plus for every day they don't pay you, they are actually supposed to give you some penalty fees. They usually pay it once they realize it's Oregon state law.""

He sent the letter letting them know of the new amount. The company I quit was based in Texas and they responded with a letter of their own, saying, ""No, we will not be paying any additional fees."" 

My father in law then sent another letter stating, ""This part is non-negotiable, it is Oregon state law. Adhere to it."" He also told me he wasn't going to charge me, but he was going to start keeping track of his billable hours to see if he can recoup some of this in the long run.

"Many years ago, when I tried to explain to my manager, Mike, that the latest project would require more time than he allotted, he told me a story:

As a teenager, Mike had worked at a fast food restaurant. There was an external seating area at this restaurant they called ""the enclosure."" It was well known for getting very, very messy.

One day Mike was told by his manager to clean up the enclosure. He was given one hour to do this.

He did his best. He gathered up all of the loose garbage, he wiped up all of the spills, he put everything in order that he could. However, at the end of that hour, the enclosure was not up to his manager's standards, and so he received an informal reprimand.

The next day, the enclosure was just as messy as ever, and so his manager decided to teach him a lesson. His manager said pointedly that he was going to clean up the enclosure perfectly, and do so in only 15 minutes, while Mike watched.

Sure enough, due to experience, planning, skill, and intelligence, his manager had this area perfect in less than 15 minutes. End of story.

And so, according to Mike, this taught him there was *always* enough time to get the work done, no matter what it was. I should not be making excuses about insufficient time.

What I wanted to say at this point: Okay, Mike, go ahead and write, test, and debug this code for me *yourself* in the two days you have allotted.

What I actually said: Mike, it sounds like your manager at that fast food restaurant was much more accomplished at his job than any inexperienced teenager could possibly be.

And since your boss will never have enough money and it will never come fast enough, nothing you do will ever be enough for them.  Come in on a weekend to catch up?  Your job will start expecting that all the time and will grow ""concerned about your motivation"" if you dont do it.  Answer an email after hours?  The next time you don't, they are ""concerned about your dedication"".  Do double the work to fill in for someone who's on leave or for an open position?  The second you assert boundaries or express concern about this, you arent ""being a team player"".  Use vacation time that is allocated to you?

1. It's not a start up. She claimed it was. despite it being an instagram page and not a legitimate company, the page itself carried name/brand recognition locally. The page was kind of like a local events/news page that has a strong youth demographic, which I thought would look good on my portfolio when it comes to interviews and being asked for experience (experience is cruical here). She would call herself a startup since she claimed to generate revenue via paid sponsorships at events and on her page, claimed to own a marketing company (never gave me details on, dont even know if its true), she gave me bullshit about hiring more interns to create more content (which she never did, and then walked back on when we asked about it multiple times), gave me bullshit on hiring people to create a website (which still hasn't been created). Partned with a small media company (which she later on ended association with without telling me, which led me to film all the events) 
Until now, the company consists of one person. So yeah, I was scammed. 

2. No need to take legal action, theyre already fucked and I actually got what I wanted out of this ""internship"" despite the fact that I pretty much taught myself everything about creating social media content and taking and editing videos on my own, i just consider this personal portfolio work i probably woudve done on my own, the fact that it was for the page just lent it credibility as ""experience"". So all that's added to my portfolio, she can't take away from me. Every other unpaid intern, employee or buisness partner she had lasted around a month before quitting, her retention rate is zero, she has lost 3 people on her team so far. Her page is gonna go to shit since me and the other intern quit, since we're the only people who made content for the page were just going to sit back and watch her page go nowhere, she has no chance of going anywhere with the way she treats her employees, especially unpaid interns who are treated like garbage like i was, only i had the patience to put up with it for so long, the silver lining is that she said she no longer plans on recruiting unpaid interns because they all end up leaving (no shit) and she doesnt have the time to invest in ""training"" them, and if she does hire someone they'll either quit since she's so toxic and doesn't know how to manage 2 people let alone a group or report her for breach of contract/not paying a salary which she'll probably end up doing just like she did with my ""internship certificate"" from the internet which i woudve used to wipe my ass with.

- Salary non-exempt is guaranteed wages, even if working less hours, but still gets an OT premium if working a lot of hours.
- Hourly exempt is getting a high base wage, but no OT premium.
- Salary exempt is getting a higher fixed wage, no matter the number of hours.",lfnbsvg,antiwork,1722346962.0

"Instead of being jealous of the people a little higher in the hierarchy, see them as another worker who is trying to do what you are- surviving on their income.

The real ones to despise are the top ones taking the maximum from what is produced. You know, the C-suite and owner class.

They are the ones who control the game, taking the largest share of business income and keeping very little for the majority below them. They have the largest holding of company shares as insiders and seek to profit from the market movements- not caring about workers. They don't work, only command. Because those below them actually do all the work.

It's called cash cow. To them the business is a cash cow that has to be milked efficiently. All workers are not people, only the facilitating resources of their milking of the cash cow. Unfortunately, investors have the same motivation. Basically, owners only want to milk the cash cow (business) as much as possible. Everything else is secondary and just a minor cost to keep the cash cow healthy for more milk (money).",lfnctqe,antiwork,1722347326.0

With the cost of living in WA, the pay that new workers get is barely enough to rent a damned room!

I commuted about 1.5-2 hours to work and then again, back to home when I was there, as I had to live with my parent.

I was fortunate that a coworker had a room available about 9 months into my working there, and I moved in with them. But it was tough trying to pay rent and utilities, not to mention food and such, with the ridiculously low pay we were getting.

The progression steps that one goes through to max out at the top is 6.5 years. Due to my job code, I started out making $19 an hour, with $1 differential for being on 2nd shift. And you take a ""step"" every 6 months, with an increase of 50 cents.

It takes too long to make a liveable wage there, and it's absolutely ridiculous!

They build airplanes! You'd think they would want to train and retain people who are skilled workers, but with the laughably low wages, I knew so many people who left because they weren't making enough to afford to live and support themselves, let alone their family.

Not to mention that for every worker on the floor, there is likely about 3 times the ""management"" above them, breathing down their necks about why things are taking too long.

There are so many issues with getting parts from vendors, they rely too much on outside vendors when they used to do the bulk of it in-house, and knew the quality of the materials and parts they had because their own workers were producing and manufacturing them.

I ended up moving to another state for other reasons, but even so, my significant other works for them down here and makes $15 more an hour, non-union here, than they did in WA after working there 4 years.

Now we’re mostly deregulated, OSHA rules continually broken, workers fought for raises, finally get them and runaway inflation from Capital means grocery prices have skyrocketed, and we now hearGOP leadership saying out loud how Working Class needs to be squashed, work till you die, taxed more than billionaires, and frankly, I’d like to know: 

When will working class pick a day or a week or a month to take the time for a national strike.  

We run this country, our rich counterparts are openly hostile, stealing our time, our labor, our sweat, and tell us fuck you??  

It’s time, people.  

We need them to pay 80% tax after their first 10m.  

We need them to know their place in decent society - it doesn’t mean CEO class  get to continue taking 90% profits, we need profit sharing back to All employees.  

We need caps on CEO pay, bonuses, and wage theft must be addressed with actual prison time, no tiny fine that is meaningless.  

Are we not exhausted from having our bones picked clean by the Ben Shapiro of this world?  That loser was born on third base bec daddy’s money, fuck that pos!

Without the gathering together, without yelling protest language, the goo squads have no reason to throw tear gas or batons.  Silently we will move our goal posts back, refund infrastructure, re-fund insurance (CEO class makes millions denying your claims, denying cancer treatments so our family members die so they can buy another yacht???)

"\*Edit 9/6/24:

Since a lot of people seem to misunderstand how this works, I'll clarify. The obligation of an employer is to maintain accurate timekeeping for every employee. How they do this isn't regulated, but the information required is. (hours worked per day, clock in/out times, breaks, paid wages, etc.) This means they don't have to use a time clock, but if they do, they must still report accurate hours for the employee with that system.

In the OP's case they have a malfunctioning time clock system. That's an employer problem, not an employee one, but the employer is threatening not to pay employees for hours \*they should know the employee is working.\* If this came up in litigation or a labor dispute at a state/local level, the employer would be on the hook to show that the employee did not work using the \*accurate hours they are required by law to keep.\*

The first response to that requirement would be the (correct) statement that their time clock system is not functioning properly and therefore they are not keeping accurate records. In several states (California/NY/et al) the lack of accurate employer records alone is sufficient basis to rely solely on employee verbal claims for damages, since it is not the employees job to keep  the accurate records. In other states a simple written record kept by the employee with dates/times is sufficient.

Also - you people trying to defend the employer need to knock it off. Their job is to maintain accurate records and they are failing to do so. Getting upset because I don't tolerate nonsense from employers doesn't make me upset it just makes you look like a weirdo.  


Previous:

So this is an interesting scenario where its actually fairly cut and dry how its handled. Employers are responsible for accurately reporting hours, full stop. It doesn't matter if an employee time clock doesn't work, or they forget to report, or what have you. \*Accurately\* reporting that time (and taxes etc) is the sole responsibility of the employer.

They can punish employees for failing to report hours, even fire them, but they cannot simply assume you are not at work when they should reasonably know otherwise. That is fraud, and is a crime. The correct action in scenarios where employee hours are uncertain is to pay tentative or estimated hours as usual for the pay period and verify after the fact. (e.g. if they normally work 40 hours/week, pay them the 40 hours and adjust any difference on the next paycheck)

You can read more about that sort of thing below, but basically, if an employer knows (or should know) about work being done, they must accurately account for and pay for it.

"A lot of people are confused by this post, so I will explain a little bit about the fucked tax system we have here in America.

Corporations don't pay taxes on losses. That part seems pretty common sense, but it gets over complicated and very fucked up from there.

If the Corporation can prove that the loss is continous, they can continue to get a tax credit. So for the farm analogy, the farm burning down is a loss now; but is also a loss next year since there won't be a harvest.

If the farm is at its maximum output, or is failing/value diminishing, the best thing for a corpo to do is ""lock in"" the value of the farm by losing it. They get the equivalent tax credit for its harvest every year without risk of the crop failing or value diminishing.

The farm (or any revenue source) needs to not only be profitable, but needs to be growing. Once it hits its max, or there is risk of reduced profit, killing it to keep as a permanent tax credit is more worthwhile.",l3hsouh,antiwork,1715378464.0

They can't cut supply costs, because their suppliers are under the same shareholder pressures they are and will never cut prices.

">“The works of the roots of the vines, of the trees, must be destroyed to keep up the price, and this is the saddest, bitterest thing of all. Carloads of oranges dumped on the ground. The people came for miles to take the fruit, but this could not be. How would they buy oranges at twenty cents a dozen if they could drive out and pick them up? And men with hoses squirt kerosene on the oranges, and they are angry at the crime, angry at the people who have come to take the fruit. A million people hungry, needing the fruit- and kerosene sprayed over the golden mountains. And the smell of rot fills the country. Burn coffee for fuel in the ships. Burn corn to keep warm, it makes a hot fire. Dump potatoes in the rivers and place guards along the banks to keep the hungry people from fishing them out. Slaughter the pigs and bury them, and let the putrescence drip down into the earth.

>There is a crime here that goes beyond denunciation. There is a sorrow here that weeping cannot symbolize. There is a failure here that topples all our success. The fertile earth, the straight tree rows, the sturdy trunks, and the ripe fruit. And children dying of pellagra must die because a profit cannot be taken from an orange. And coroners must fill in the certificate- died of malnutrition- because the food must rot, must be forced to rot. The people come with nets to fish for potatoes in the river, and the guards hold them back; they come in rattling cars to get the dumped oranges, but the kerosene is sprayed. And they stand still and watch the potatoes float by, listen to the screaming pigs being killed in a ditch and covered with quick-lime, watch the mountains of oranges slop down to a putrefying ooze; and in the eyes of the people there is the failure; and in the eyes of the hungry there is a growing wrath. In the souls of the people the grapes of wrath are filling and growing heavy, growing heavy for the vintage.”

"Reminds me of the time where I was on vacation in Singapore and I was scheduled to work for my second week of vacation. I decided to make an international call to the east coast of Canada to tell them I couldn't show up unless they wanted to reimburse me for a week's worth of an overseas trip plus airfare. 

Apparently he didn't check the blockout book. I still wish I could have seen the long distance charge for that call.

Then my last few days there I was scheduled for the end of that week. I couldn't call but whatever , I should be back home by then right? WRONG. Get turned around halfway from Toronto and the rescheduled flight was cancelled the next morning. The 2nd rescheduled flight wasn't supposed to leave until Wednesday meaning I wouldn't be home until Thursday morning at the earliest. 

I had to make another long distance call (this time I was getting charged too rip) asking them what they were doing as the store manager said she wouldn't schedule me until the week AFTER I came back. I basically told them the  situation and that Thursday morning's shift was an automatic no-go, as was Friday's. They insisted on Saturday and i told them there was a good chance that our flights may get cancelled AGAIN and that the SM assured me I wouldn't be scheduled until I got back. Managers got pissed but had to figure things out themselves.

Long story short, my travel agent got me back home that night but i was jet lagged for several days due to all the screw ups and my store manager wasn't impressed with the other managers that scheduled me and gave me a hard time during my vacation. 

And before anyone asks ""why weren't you charged for the long distance call the first time?"" Singtel (at the time, idk about now, it's  been almost 10 years) had a Tourist Sim program where you could get a SIM card that lasted either  5 or 10 days (your choice) and covered so many minutes of an international call on YOUR end.

"You see, there are two levels. The people with the money are on the top level. The people without the money are on the bottom level.

The people with money can do whatever they want without consequence. Attempting to make them see consequences makes them angry and they lash out and harm everyone and everything out of spite.

The people of that bottom can barely survive, and have to deal with their own consequences as well as the consequences that were meant for the people at the top level. Some believe its better to keep their head down and take the top consequences as they come, because if they try to give them back to the top, the top people will thrash about and make things even worse.

"3 simultaneous economic events that lasted for about the last 60+years in the US


1. The active Globalization of the world economy has steadily moved industries out of the developed world to lower cost countries.  Literally removing jobs.

2. A massive glut of labor from the babyboomers who were economically rewarded for being more productive and working more hours.  This lead to a culture of making work life because it Paid to do so.

3. Steady organized erosion of worker protections and labor law and the gradual capture of regulatory agencies and lawmakers.


To paraphrase a HR exec I knew who was 84 in 2010, no one has told anyone at the top No in the last 40 years and you have to be as old as me to remember a time when there was anything approaching not having a glut of labor wiling to work.

I got into a pickle with the car (a 2017 hyundai elantra). Engine was just shy of blowing, insurance was going up, it wasn't drivable, and I still owed 16 grand on it (dealership refused to honor their extended engine warranty on it).

I had my hours cut at my job and I was frantically trying to find something to keep the money flowing in while driving a deer wrecked 03 corolla with a leaky radiator and even leakier engine. I fell behind on both the CC and car payment, but was making an effort to send money, even though it wasn't the full payment. Started getting threatening calls that weren't ringing through. Straight to vm for some reason.

I would try to call right back and would be routed through a nightmare system and never could get a live person. I wanted to work with someone to get my payments caught up. Going to the in person branch was no help. They would just give me the contact info for the resolution team.

I got a notice that if I didn't catch the car up, they would start proceedings to collect it. I surrendered it. AND THEY LOST THE CAR.

They sent the repo team after me and were trying to find it for SIX MONTHS, even though I kept forwarding them the document I signed upon surrender. They would be blatantly parked in the church parking lot across the street and follow me when I'd leave my apartment. Any time I tried to approach them to show them the document of surrender, they would take off.

They finally found the car in one of their storage lots and hit me with a bunch of BS fees and what was owed after the car was sold (surprise, it didn't sell for much). They wanted every penny right now. Oh, and they closed my cc and other accounts when I surrendered the car and wanted that money right now too

30 days after they sold the car, they nailed me with a lawsuit for each the car and the cc and were extremely aggressive. Mind you, I kept trying to reach out to them to work out a payment plan we could both live with prior to this... no dice.

LA Fitness: NEVER work for these people. They will make you slaves to the system. I was a personal training director, hitting well above my sales goals (I was the number one seller of personal training in my state for 3 months at one point). I was working 8am to 8pm every day. I had a split shift though, with a 2.5 hour break in the middle. And then on Saturdays I had to be in from 8am to 12. 5 1/5 day work weeks. It was never enough. It was mad. 

My favorite story is LA Fitness would not let me pause an older man’s monthly training payments. He had just lost his wife to a brain aneurysm 2 weeks prior, and his last kid just went off to college. He was a wreak and wanted to pause payments for 3 months. My boss, the district vise president and the regional vise president said “NO.” The man had tears in his eyes. He was paying $350 a month for training. I was able to find a workaround by have to call our HR team and direct me to the Vise President of Personal Training and was able to pause billing. Wanna know what LA fitness did?

"Someone puts my license in jeopardy with shenanigans, I'll cut them off from using it in a New York second. 

Letters to regulators disputing any use of my license and repudiation of of any use of my license for anything that I'm not completely comfortable with. 

CC goes to the company as a mere courtesy. 

If you're using my license or credit or anything else you WILL run everything 100% square. 

Also, if you're using MY license for YOUR profit you'll be paying my contract  rate which is $1400/ day or partial day; or $5500/month minimum. 

Period. You don't ever get to use my license for employee rates.

The very first thing you should do upon leaving is file formal notice with the regulatory board that they're no longer affiliated with you and do not have ANY permission to use your license for anything. I'd also back check their insurance as they may have listed you as a Primary without your permission. 

I'd also definitely repudiate any and all sleezy work (with specifics) by them and place those turds firmly back in their pocket before anything blows. 

Source: Licensed Contractor and had a boss do that shit to me when I was young and stoopid. Shit did blow up on him, but my repudiation letters to the license board kept me and my insurance in the clear.

"I have actually had this happen to me, and badge, laptop, and other company-owned assets were involved (including stuff that was of a highly sensitive nature). 

I pinged the HR rep that was involved with the process and let her know what was up (and BCC’ed myself).  Then I went to the security office for the company’s campus, had them file a report as to why I had to turn in property to them instead of using the HR process. Requested and received a copy of the report, including the statement from security that they made several attempts to contact him via phone, IM, and even had someone go to his work area to try and find him. 

They weren’t happy about the situation, and because I’m a nice guy, I treated them to dinner while they did the legwork and paperwork. 

Got a call on Monday afternoon from another company HR rep as to why I hadn’t turned in my company-owned assets, told that this was considered theft, etc. I responded by telling them that everything was sitting in a safe at the campus security office, that HR was notified, and that the only reason this was done was because the manager never showed up, as he was REQUIRED to do. I then mentioned that this was the same type of behavior that caused me to leave the company in the first place, and that a security report had been filed due to the nature of his violation… and that I had a copy of it in case he wanted to dispute things. 

Got a thank you, an apology for the situation and that’s the last I heard from them aside from the paperwork and last paycheck they sent in the mail. 

Not sure how much of an effect it had with HR, but they fired the manager about 8 weeks later.",lkrjqne,antiwork,1725066309.0

"There's the investment economy, essentially legalized gambling - and the real economy that the rest of us depend on.  

As the gambling economy extracts wealth from the real economy it grows larger while the material economy shrinks due to inflation and reduced capacity for spending.  

The higher the wealth concentration in the hands of people who can use it to gamble the greater the risk to the real market values on which it depends, especially when that wealth is not legitimately reinvested.  

When we allow our economy to grow so top heavy wherein the leveraged value far outweighs the true costs and reasonable investments, the house ceases to be able to cover the cost of the bets and we find ourselves in yet another ballooning investment economy that will need bailing out in the next five years by the real economy.",l58clx1,antiwork,1716413124.0
