The actual post.  
And the full text for those who can't read it:

Like many of you, I watched the debate tonight. If you haven’t already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most. As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country.  
  
Recently I was made aware that AI of ‘me’ falsely endorsing Donald Trump’s presidential run was posted to his site. It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation. It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth.  
  
I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election. I’m voting for [@ kamalaharris](https://www.instagram.com/kamalaharris/?hl=en) because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate [@timwalz](https://www.instagram.com/timwalz/?hl=en), who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman’s right to her own body for decades.  
  
I’ve done my research, and I’ve made my choice. Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make. I also want to say, especially to first time voters: Remember that in order to vote, you have to be registered! I also find it’s much easier to vote early. I’ll link where to register and find early voting dates and info in my story.  
  
With love and hope,

**EDIT:** Response from the Harris team: 

*“Donald Trump is running scared and trying to back out of the debate he already agreed to and running straight to Fox News to bail him out. He needs to stop playing games and show up to the debate he already committed to on Sept 10. The Vice President will be there one way or the other to take the opportunity to speak to a prime time national audience.*

Trump is proud of the fact that he is *not normal*. We have a word for that but it escapes me at the moment.

Or if Kim Jong-Un threatens to nuke South Korea again. Or another crisis like Covid for that matter. Real leaders don't get to pick their circumstances. They either step up or step aside. They don't try to weasel out of the situation at hand and make excuses.

Biden showed up to debate even knowing he was sick and that it would reflect poorly on him. He did it anyway. He didn't complain about circumstances or try to avoid them. And when it became apparent he wasn't best suited to represent his party in November, he stepped aside in favor of someone who is.

"Page 307 of [Project 2025](https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf):  Make all food labeling purely ""voluntary"" with no penalties for false or misleading food labels.

> The next Administration should: . . . **Repeal the federal labeling mandate.** The USDA should work with Congress to repeal the federal labeling law, while maintaining federal preemption, and stress that voluntary labeling is allowed.

(emphasis in original)

Every person with food allergies or specific diets will be rolling dice on any food they didn't farm and prepare 100% themselves.

Although some prefacing language says their supposed goal is simply to ""remove obstacles"" for bioengineered foods (like GMOs), the actual action recommended is a full repeal of the entire food labeling law.  No exceptions.  Maintenance of ""federal preemption"" means that no state can pass their own food labeling law in response.

The federal food labeling law is Section 403 of the FD&C Act (21 USC § 343).

> Under section 403 of the FD&C Act (21 USC § 343), **every food label must contain the name of the food, a statement of the net quantity of contents (typically net weight), and the name and address of the manufacturer or distributor**. Even today, some foods are lawfully marketed with labels that bear only these three items of information, although most labels contain more. Most notably, all but a few FDA-regulated foods must also bear a list of ingredients in descending order of predominance. The exception, however, is an important one: Foods for which FDA has established a standard of identity need not list ingredients that the standard makes mandatory.

> In addition to requiring these affirmative statements on food labels, the FD&C Act prohibits other statements; most significantly, it **prohibits statements that are false or misleading** in any particular. A related provision, section 201(n) (21 USC § 321(n)), specifies that in determining whether the labeling of a food is misleading, ""there shall be taken into account . . . not only representations made or suggested . . . but also the extent to which the labeling . . . fails to reveal facts material in light of such representations. . . ."" This was the U.S. Congress's way of recognizing that half-truths can often be as misleading as outright misrepresentations.

"***From Rolling Stone's Nikki McCann Ramirez:***

Election conspiracy theorist Tina Peters has been convicted of tampering with voting machines in Mesa County, Colorado, in the aftermath of the 2020 election. On Monday, Peters was found guilty of seven charges related to her efforts to grant unauthorized individuals access to country voting machines in order to prove false claims that the election had been fraudulently stolen from Donald Trump.

In March, Peters pleaded not guilty to 10 criminal charges, including seven felonies, in connection to a scheme to use her position as Mesa County clerk to transfer voting data from the machines to allies of former President Trump. She resigned from her role as Mesa County clerk in 2023.

Peters’ sentencing is scheduled to take place on October 3.

“This community has suffered greatly from the dishonesty, lack of transparency and refusal of Ms. Peters to take accountability,” Mesa County District Attorney Daniel P. Rubinstein said in response to the verdict. “No single elected official, or even branch of government, is above the law or should be allowed to act without those checks and balances.”

"So a recap: 

1. Elon pledges his support for Donald Trump, along with $45 million dollar donation per month to a Trump super PAC until election day.

2. Elon throttles the number of followers for Kamala Harris' twitter account, preventing more people from seeing her latest tweets. 

3. Elon Musk puts his own tweets as top priority in the algorithm, so you always see his tweets regardless if you follow him or not.


4. Elon shares a fake Kamala Harris political ad that was AI generated and got over 120 million views.

6. Elon bans White Dudes for Harris because they were drawing in money for Harris' campaign. 

7. Elon regularly allows hate speech (like racism and misogyny) on his platform and allows it to be used against individuals he doesn't like, such as Kamala Harris. When negative posts are directed at him over proven facts, such as the nature of his family fortune, those users are banned because ""defamation is not free speech."" So in Elon's mind, it's okay to spew hate speech against groups of people or against individuals he doesn't like, but not him. 

8. Elon shares and comments on anti-vaccine disinformation and blames Democrats.

9. Elon continues to tweet and retweet anti-LGBT rhetoric and misogyny, and treats his bigotry and opinions as facts while banning others who try to support LGBT individuals, including his own daughter.

"It continues. Six days ago, *The New York Times* [ran a story](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/10/us/politics/trump-campaign-election.html) under the headline “Inside the Worst Three Weeks of Donald Trump’s 2024 Campaign.” Usually, when the country’s most important newspaper runs a story like that, the candidate pays a little attention and the ship begins to right itself. But in this case, it’s just gotten worse. The ship is capsizing, and the captain is losing his marbles.

Right after that story ran, Trump came out with his wild accusation that Kamala Harris’s crowd of thousands at a Detroit airplane hangar was fake. The next night, he did that weird, to borrow an au courant word, interview with Elon Musk, where he made more WTF comments than I can recount, capped by his vow to move to Venezuela (a country ruled by a corrupt autocrat who just cheated massively in this month’s election) if he loses. On Wednesday, he gave a rambling speech at a North Carolina rally.

Then, on Thursday, we had a little taste of some [peak Trump crazy](https://newrepublic.com/post/184939/donald-trump-derails-press-conference-campaign-strategy). He claimed Harris is responsible for [a law in California](https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-160551360299) that says [it’s OK to steal](https://x.com/atrupar/status/1824188075989155864) from a grocery store as long as your take is under $950.

He made strange comments about Cheerios. He lectured Jews (at a later event) about how if the Democrats win, Jewish people “don’t have a chance” in America, [saying of Harris](https://www.katv.com/news/beyond-the-podium/jewish-voices-for-trump-coalition-formed-to-combat-antisemitism-2024-presidential-election-politics)—whose husband is Jewish—that “she doesn’t like Jewish people. You know it, I know it, and everybody knows it, and nobody wants to say it.” And we can’t forget the assertion that more than 100 percent of recent U.S. jobs have gone to migrants.

Meanwhile, what else is Harris doing? Starting to unveil an economic package that, so far anyway, looks pretty great. It’s aimed straight at middle-class voters and focused on housing and grocery prices. You can’t get more kitchen table than that. And the bit about [going after corporate price gougers](https://newrepublic.com/article/184937/harris-price-gouging-corporations) is great. It sends a nice populist signal that she’s willing to make some enemies.

We’re coming up on a month now of Harris being the candidate. That isn’t much time, granted, and of course the race is still in margin-of-error territory and at some point

But all that said, the Harris campaign has been as shrewd as any presidential campaign I’ve ever seen. Her stump speech is excellent. The choice of Walz was great—their personal chemistry is so evident in that video they just released of the two of them chatting about spicy food and whatnot (the right is trying to gin up outrage over Walz saying he eats “white-guy tacos”).

The response to the letter was more than passing strange. Other mental health professionals rose to denounce the letter and its signatories. One was Allen Frances, the prestigious chairman of the task force that wrote the “Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV”, considered psychiatry’s diagnostic bible. Dr Frances had two problems with the letter. The first was, he said, that Trump was too successful to be mentally ill – a bizarre argument that sounded like one Trump would make himself. “Mr. Trump,” Dr. Frances intoned, “causes severe distress rather than experiencing it and has been richly rewarded, rather than punished, for his grandiosity, self-absorption and lack of empathy.” 

Therefore Trump could not possibly be mentally ill, Frances concluded, apparently unaware of erratic politicians in world history who have achieved success in the exact terms defined by their insanity. Frances added, with an apparently unintentional touch of humour, that pronouncing Trump mentally ill was an insult to the mentally ill.

Reacting to the negative backlash, the Times then published an article about the controversy by Richard Friedman, a psychiatrist. Friedman referred to what is known in American psychiatry as the Goldwater rule. This was the American Psychiatric Association’s official prohibition against mental health professionals making a public diagnosis of a politician’s mental health. That edict itself was a response to mental health professionals participating, in 1964, in a public survey and judging then Republican candidate for president, Barry Goldwater, mentally unfit to be president. Siding with the APA, Friedman finished by declaring that clinically judging Trump to be mentally ill would let him “off the moral hook”. And from that point on, liberal attacks on Trump were unfailingly moral, a tactic that soon degenerated into a grossly ineffectual torrent of moral hubris, virtue-mongering and sanctimony.

There are, of course, sound reasons to resist declaring Trump mentally unsound. At this late moment in American civilisation, the concept of mental illness is nearly impossible to clarify. When I wrote, in 2017, about the dust-up over whether Trump should be publicly diagnosed, my very own therapist at the time paused in the middle of one of our sessions to scold me for doing so. The weapon of psychological stigma can be used, like impeachment, against any rival or adversary. In 2011, a psychologist named Drew Westen enraged people by publishing, again in the Times, a lengthy essay arguing, in effect, that Obama did not have the “character” to be president (a “deep-seated aversion to conflict”; “tic-like gestures of compromise”).

It could well be that the debate over whether it was acceptable to call Trump mentally unfit to be president is at the heart of the weird debate over who is more weird, the Democrats or the Republicans. America is becoming unrecognisable, so fast, in so many ways, to so many different types of people, that the words “weird” and “sick” are being anxiously domesticated into neutral terms of description. Yet, in the end, the unclarity is all the more reason to be vigilant about truly aberrant figures slipping into leadership of the country under the cover of a revolution of norms. Trump is truly aberrant. Everyone knows it, his supporters as much as his detractors. No one talks like this man. No one abuses other people like this man. No one misrepresents reality like this man. And he is not lying. He is describing what he perceives, which is not what is actually there.

Biden’s relational skills, his empathy, his moral perception of reality were never the issue. He had been, by all appearances and accounts, a mentally stable man all his life. That is why his cognitive decline became so apparent, once his entourage stopped shielding him. It is harder to discern Trump’s cognitive decline, because his behaviour, ironically, serves the same purpose as Biden’s entourage, obscuring the decline it is a symptom of. But anyone watching him abruptly change subjects in his acceptance speech at the Republican convention, anyone who listened to that speech and watched him disappear into the rabbit hole of his own mind, can see that he is even further along in his deterioration than Biden.

The liberal media cried wolf in 2016, and now they are afraid to ring the alarm bells when it is vital to ring them. After January 6 and the spectacle of watching the effects of Trump’s “personal myth of greatness” being challenged, now is the time to apply the same scrutiny of Trump’s mental condition that was applied to Biden – the appearance of throwing stones from glass houses be damned. Having been criticised for questioning Trump’s sanity in 2017, and despite the daily evidence that Trump’s faculties are clearly degenerating, the ferociously partisan liberal press wishes to present itself as dignified and above the fray. Yet what was good for the octogenarian gander with declining faculties but an intact moral centre should be equally good for the septuagenarian gander with declining faculties and a pathologically absent moral centre. The great blessing in life, and the great curse, is that people can get used to just about anything.

Pennsylvania polling uses a larger sample size which tightens the race though Trump still leads in registered and likely voters when it's a head to head match up between Trump and Biden.  With RFK Jr included that lead switches to Biden marginally leading Trump.

Michigan polling shows Trump leading again in a head to head match but, like Pennsylvania, Biden marginally leads Trump with RFK Jr included.

"It’s about time. In the decades since Nixon began the War On Drugs as a way to remove voting rights from brown people and young people, America has become a nation of for profit prisons, with a majority of those prisoners doing time for non-violent drug crimes.

**Edit:** Nixon created DEA in 1973, ostensibly because of Americas huge drug problem at the time. For reference, there were 6,413 heroin overdose deaths in the US in 1973 (population  was 210,284,000). Not sure if that qualifies as a huge problem compared to alcohol or cigarettes, but that's just my opinion.

My comment, **which should have said brown people and young people AKA ""hippies""** was more spurred by John Ehrlichman's (Nixon's domestic policy advisor) statements from a 2016 Harper's cover story which described Nixon's plan:

""... by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.""

So, ruining people's lives has always been a core part of the War On Drugs (see Mandatory Minimum Sentencing). The voting thing was just a bonus. I should have been more specific.

"> In her dissent, Sotomayor wrote that the majority’s opinion will now protect this exact type of conduct.

>“The president of the United States is the most powerful person in the country, and possibly the world,” wrote Sotomayor. “When he uses his official powers in any way, under the majority’s reasoning, he now will be insulated from criminal prosecution. Orders the Navy’s Seal Team 6 to assassinate a political rival? Immune. Organizes a military coup to hold onto power? Immune. Takes a bribe in exchange for a pardon? Immune. Immune, immune, immune.”

edit: from the majority:

>(3) Presidents cannot be indicted based on conduct for which they are immune from prosecution. On remand, the District Court must carefully analyze the indictment’s remaining allegations to determine whether they too involve conduct for which a President must be immune from prosecution. And the parties and the District Court must ensure that sufficient allegations support the indictment’s charges without such conduct. **Testimony or private records of the President or his advisers probing such conduct may not be admitted as evidence at trial.** Pp. 30–32

An incredible amount of evidence of a president's criminal acts are inadmissible to the Supreme Court! What this means:

>Finally, Roberts does concede that the president may be prosecuted for “unofficial” acts. So, for example, if Trump had personally attempted to shoot and kill then-presidential candidate Joe Biden in the lead-up to the 2020 election, rather than ordering a subordinate to do so, then Trump could probably be prosecuted for murder.

>But even this caveat to Roberts’s sweeping immunity decision is not very strong. Roberts writes that “in dividing official from unofficial conduct, courts may not inquire into the President’s motives.” And Roberts even limits the ability of prosecutors to pursue a president who accepts a bribe in return for committing an official act, such as pardoning a criminal who pays off the president. In Roberts’s words, a prosecutor may not “admit testimony or private records of the President or his advisers probing the official act itself.”

>That means that, [while the president can be prosecuted for an “unofficial” act, the prosecutors may not prove that he committed this crime using evidence drawn from the president’s “official” actions.](https://www.vox.com/scotus/358292/supreme-court-trump-immunity-dictatorship)

>The practical implications of this ruling are astounding. As Justice Sonia Sotomayor writes in a dissenting opinion, “imagine a President states in an official speech that he intends to stop a political rival from passing legislation that he opposes, no matter what it takes to do so,” it follows from Roberts’s opinion that the ensuing murder indictment “could include no allegation of the President’s public admission of premeditated intent to support” the proposition that the president intended to commit murder.",lb4w5j4,politics,1719846115.0

Remember to Vote! This [Presidential Election](https://ballotpedia.org/Presidential_Elections) is important but it’s good to know who else you’ll be voting for on the 5th.

A total of 468 seats in the U.S. Congress are up for election! That’s 33 seats in the [Senate](https://ballotpedia.org/United_States_Senate_elections,_2024) 
and all 435 in the [House of Representatives](https://ballotpedia.org/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2024) 

It’s good to look at [Local Elections](https://ballotpedia.org/United_States_municipal_elections,_2024) Today! For instance I’m in Arizona. Here’s info for all y’all sweating out here with me. 

We have 9 districts out here in Arizona, 9 seats. Know your district. Know who’s running in your district and how they voted in the past. Who pays for the campaigns. All that info is public and in the links. This year it’s important to know a few things before checking that box.

* Eli Crane of Arizona D2
* Andy Biggs of Arizona D5
* Debbie Lesko of Arizona D8
* Paul Gosar of Arizona D9

We have one senate seat up this year. Looking to represent Arizona is Ruben Gallego or Mark Lamb. Make sure the person representing Arizona best represents you! 
[Senate election in Arizona 2024](https://ballotpedia.org/United_States_Senate_election_in_Arizona,_2024)

[Mark Lamb](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Lamb_(sheriff)) is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and became American law-enforcement Sheriff in 2017.

He wrote American Sheriff: Traditional Values in a Modern World. Lamb is a supporter of the Stop the Steal movement. He spoke at a rally where he said the riot was not Trump's fault but rather caused by ""the other issues that have happened – the Hillary Clintons that have gone unpunished"".He later described the rioters as ""very loving, Christian people.""

In 2020, Lamb spoke at a convention of the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, an organization that holds the fringe legal theory that sheriffs are the supreme legal authority in the United States and are not required to enforce laws they believe to be unconstitutional.

[Ruben Gallego](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruben_Gallego) 3rd Battalion, 25th Marines. Attended Harvard University and earned a Bachelor of Arts in international relations. 

His first successful bill passed in 2011 it granted in-state tuition status to veterans residing in Arizona. Gallego supported the repeal of Arizona SB 1070. He wrote They Called Us ""Lucky"": The Life and Afterlife of the Iraq War's Hardest Hit Unit, published in 2021. 

Gallego founded the group Citizens for Professional Law Enforcement with the goal of recalling Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, citing Arpaio's immigration policies and his use of taxpayer money to investigate Barack Obama's citizenship.

We have two seats in the [Arizona Supreme Court](https://ballotpedia.org/Arizona_Supreme_Court_elections,_2024) up for election on November 5, 2024. The Justices up for retention election are Clint Bolick and Kathryn Hackett King. If retained, they will serve six year terms. Gov. Doug Ducey (R) appointed both justices to the supreme court.

"The last few days could not have been any more of a nightmare for Trump world, given how unexpectedly well-executed this pivot has been for the Democrats. I don't think anyone predicted it could go this well:

* Dems have immediately unified behind Harris and practically ended their infighting. Any cracks in the first 48 hours could have been fatal, but it's clear that the party is rock solid behind this.
* Harris is much improved as a speaker compared to even a few years ago, and is ready to meet the moment, and serve as a perfect foil for the opponent she is facing. Her initial speeches have been well received, and she's already hit on a slogan that's resonating with voters (""We're not going back"").
* The Democrat base has done a complete 180, and is now super energised and raring to go. Trump is relying on demoralised Dem voters and depressed turnout to win. This is the single biggest threat to Trump, more so than any individual candidate, and could well prove fatal for him if Dems can keep this momentum going to election day.
* Harris has managed to raise a huge amount of money in just a couple of days. The Trump campaign had *just* caught up with Biden in campaign funds, and are now lagging behind again.
* Trump is going to have to waste a good chunk of that money redoing his entire campaign, because it was fully geared around shitting on Biden specifically, rather than promoting any positive message about Trump (because there simply isn't one).
* The GOP apparently did not prepare for this scenario at all, despite egging it on for a long time, and are struggling to align on a narrative against Harris.
* Any possible bounce from the shooting and RNC has been wiped out by coverage of Biden>Harris. That Trump didn't really get a bounce from the shooting suggests he has hit probably his hard ceiling, meanwhile Harris is starting from a roughly even position with him with plenty of room to grow.
* Trump's arrogance led him to think he had the election in the bag, and has now lumbered himself with a strategically poor and unpopular VP pick.

There's still a monumental task ahead, and it's absolutely not going to be a sure thing, but I don't think the past couple of days could have gone any better for Kamala Harris.

"No surprise that Trump supporters, who are attacking Harris for the border, have no idea what she was actually tasked to do:

- In March 2021, when the Biden administration faced the early stages of an influx in illegal crossings at the U.S. southern border, Mr. Biden tasked Harris with leading the administration's diplomatic campaign to address the ""root causes"" of migration from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, including poverty, corruption and violence.

- In her immigration role, Harris' main line of work has focused on convincing companies to invest in Central America and promoting democracy and development there through diplomacy. In March of this year, the White House announced Harris had secured a commitment from the private sector to invest over $5 billion to promote economic opportunities and reduce violence in the region.

- In fiscal year 2023, for example, Border Patrol apprehensions of migrants from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador made up 22% of all crossings during that time period, down from 41% in fiscal year 2021, government statistics show.

Gov. Tim Walz on Wednesday agreed to participate in a vice presidential debate hosted by CBS News on Oct. 1 in New York City.

Former President Donald Trump's campaign has not yet agreed to the date, leaving GOP Sen. JD Vance's participation in question. 

Earlier in the day, CBS News proposed four dates for a debate between the two vice presidential nominees: Sept. 17, Sept. 24, Oct. 1, and Oct. 8. The Harris-Walz campaign soon agreed to the Oct. 1 date.

""See you on October 1, JD,"" Walz wrote on X.

A date for the vice presidential debate has been in limbo since the spring, when CBS News first extended the invitation to both presidential campaigns. In May, President Biden's campaign said Vice President Kamala Harris, who was still his running mate at the time, was willing to face off against the eventual Republican vice presidential nominee on either July 23 or Aug. 13.

"Had RFK Jr. been allowed to run in the DNC primary, he would have put up a strong fight against Biden and very well could have won the primary.

However, the DNC did not give RFK Jr. that chance. The party that claims they are fighting for democracy kicked him off the ballot and colluded with the media to engage in a smear campaign against him. 

The Democratic Party did not give RFK Jr. or his supporters a voice. They silenced them, censored them, threatened them, smeared them, and used dirty political tactics to keep him off the ballot to stop him and his supporters. 

The Trump campaign was the only one willing to cross ideological and party lines to talk with RFK’s campaign and his supporters. The Democrats and Kamala Harris were not.

The Democrats may act like RFK’s endorsement means nothing. But given RFK was polling around 5%, those votes are enough to give either Trump or Harris the election. RFK’s endorsement tilts the election in Trumps favor. It is a huge and crucial endorsement for Trump, even CNN has admitted this:

Our supply chain suffered greatly during COVID due to a JIT (just in time) inventory system, which is fairly common among manufacturers.  This disruption caused us to change our philosophy and we shifted to massively front loading our raw materials to ensure our production lines would not be disrupted.  Because of this, our suppliers started seeing massive amounts of business from other companies who made a similar shift.  These suppliers, who now had more business than they could handle, did what any smart business would do in that situation and started massively raising prices.

"Reading through both JD Vance and Tim Walz' opening paragraphs, one reads like a slam article while the other reads like praise.

Read this:

Vance has been described as a national conservative[3][4] and right-wing populist,[3][5] and he describes himself as a member of the postliberal right.[6][7] His political positions include opposition to abortion, same-sex marriage, and gun control. Vance is an outspoken critic of childlessness, linking it to sociopathy[8] and advocating that parents should have more voting power than non-parents.[9] He opposes continued American military aid to Ukraine. Vance has suggested that conservatives should use state power to forcefully re-staff institutions with ideological allies who will ""actually take a side in the culture war"".[10]

Let's see what even ChatGPT has to say about reforming this to be positive instead of negative:

https://chatgpt.com/share/dd12dd2b-4e23-4d71-b65b-ec6407205c9f

# Excerpts:

###Referencing JD Vance's last opening paragraph:

The paragraph presents a __negative direction__. It focuses on contentious political positions and actions, emphasizing opposition to widely debated issues such as abortion, same-sex marriage, and gun control. The additional references to using state power to enforce ideological conformity and increasing voting power based on parental status further suggest controversial and polarizing views. This combination of factors leans towards a portrayal that could be viewed negatively by those who oppose or are concerned by such stances.

### Referencing Tim Walz' second-to-last opening paragraph:

This paragraph has a __positive direction__. It highlights achievements and legislative successes, such as being reelected multiple times and enacting a variety of laws aimed at social improvement and safety. The inclusion of measures like free school meals, infrastructure development, and support for low-income families portrays a commitment to public welfare and progressive policies. This paints the subject in a favorable light, particularly to those who value such governmental actions.

###JD Vance's paragraph rewritten without a negative bias:

Vance is recognized as a national conservative[3][4] and right-wing populist,[3][5] and he identifies as a member of the postliberal right.[6][7] He consistently advocates for traditional values, expressing opposition to abortion, same-sex marriage, and gun control. Vance is a vocal supporter of family-focused policies, suggesting a connection between childlessness and societal issues[8] and proposing that parents be granted greater voting influence than non-parents.[9] He stands against the continuation of American military aid to Ukraine. Vance has also called for conservatives to assertively utilize state power to appoint ideological allies within key institutions, aiming to actively engage in cultural discussions.[10]

"I think you could make a very similar list from Republicans and former Trump staffers. 

A few examples:

JD Vance: called Trump “America’s Hitler.”

Anthony Scaramucci, former comms director: “He is the domestic terrorist of the 21st century.”

Stephanie Grisham, former comms director: “I am terrified of him running in 2024.”

Cassidy Hutchinson, aide to chief of staff: “I think that Donald Trump is the most grave threat we will face to our democracy in our lifetime, and potentially in American history.”

Alberto Gonzales, AG under Bush 43: “Donald Trump — perhaps the most serious threat to the rule of law in a generation.”

Just to name a few. And this is nothing of what republicans have said about Harris, Obama, Hillary, etc. 

Obviously I think politicians should always check their rhetoric. But if any of you think that the quotes in this letter are genuinely encouraging violence, you have a true disconnect from reality. 

Trump has had a very unique opportunity to use these times as a message for unity and stability in an increasingly polarized electorate. Instead, he’s using the opportunity to take cheap shots and try (seemingly succeeding here) to make his followers think that his political opponent is trying to have him killed. It’s unbecoming at the least, and untenable to the palette of those of us who remember real statesmen like Reagan, Bush, and even Obama.
