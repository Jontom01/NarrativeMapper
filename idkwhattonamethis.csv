r/conservative,"['evidence russian involvement', 'proof russian involvement', 'suspicious russian government']","This is part the letter these 'intel' agents wrote.   They do some CYA language by clarifying they don't actually know Russians are involved, but say it has the hallmarks of a Russian disinformation.  Lacking knowledge (or proof) of Russian involvement, I can't think of any reason to publish this letter other than to try to influence public opinion to be skeptical of the laptop - which afaik isn't anywhere in the job description of intelligence agencies.  

""We want to emphasize that we do not know if the emails, provided to the New York Post by President Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, are genuine or not and that we do not have evidence of Russian involvement -- just that our experience makes us deeply suspicious that the Russian government played a significant role in this case.""

Anthony Scaramucci, former comms director: “He is the domestic terrorist of the 21st century.”

Stephanie Grisham, former comms director: “I am terrified of him running in 2024.”

Cassidy Hutchinson, aide to chief of staff: “I think that Donald Trump is the most grave threat we will face to our democracy in our lifetime, and potentially in American history.”

Alberto Gonzales, AG under Bush 43: “Donald Trump — perhaps the most serious threat to the rule of law in a generation.”

Just to name a few. And this is nothing of what republicans have said about Harris, Obama, Hillary, etc. 

Obviously I think politicians should always check their rhetoric. But if any of you think that the quotes in this letter are genuinely encouraging violence, you have a true disconnect from reality. 

Trump has had a very unique opportunity to use these times as a message for unity and stability in an increasingly polarized electorate. Instead, he’s using the opportunity to take cheap shots and try (seemingly succeeding here) to make his followers think that his political opponent is trying to have him killed.

The Democratic Party did not give RFK Jr. or his supporters a voice. They silenced them, censored them, threatened them, smeared them, and used dirty political tactics to keep him off the ballot to stop him and his supporters. 

The Trump campaign was the only one willing to cross ideological and party lines to talk with RFK’s campaign and his supporters. The Democrats and Kamala Harris were not.

The Democrats may act like RFK’s endorsement means nothing. But given RFK was polling around 5%, those votes are enough to give either Trump or Harris the election. RFK’s endorsement tilts the election in Trumps favor. It is a huge and crucial endorsement for Trump, even CNN has admitted this:

He is going to use his home state to prove to America what the left has been doing.  He’s going to use NY to open everyone’s eyes to how the left has stolen this country from us.

Think back over all the cases and trials.  All the judge orders that have tried to limit Trumps behavior.  

Every time, Trump fights back, immediately.  

But when the NY judge said Trump must attend the trial, in an obvious effort to keep Trump from rallying in other states, what did Trump do?

He said ok, and started campaigning in NY.  

No pushback.  Almost like he wanted the judge to do that, isn’t it?  

Now he’s campaigning all over NY, and everyone loves him.  But this is NY!  The media told us everyone hates Trump in NY!

He’s opening America’s eyes to how the media has been lying to them.  Trump has ALL the data on NY.  He knows what his support level is there.  He knew what would happen when he started campaigning there.  

And what else is happening as he campaigns in NY?  Reporters are asking people on the streets “what do you think about all this?  What do you think about Trump?”

“we love him!”

“So what’s your message for Biden?”

“Eff him!  We’re democrats but we are voting Trump!”

Trump couldn’t ask for better campaign material.  
 
The judge will eventually be forced to stop him from campaigning in NY.  That will only open more eyes and will only increase his approval even more.  

And eventually, people in other ‘blue’ areas like CA and CO will ask themselves “Damn, if the media lied to us about Trumps support in NY, what are the chances Trump could do that here?”

Very interested to see some responses.  

Here’s one of mine speaking anecdotally from my employer:

Our supply chain suffered greatly during COVID due to a JIT (just in time) inventory system, which is fairly common among manufacturers.  This disruption caused us to change our philosophy and we shifted to massively front loading our raw materials to ensure our production lines would not be disrupted.  Because of this, our suppliers started seeing massive amounts of business from other companies who made a similar shift.  These suppliers, who now had more business than they could handle, did what any smart business would do in that situation and started massively raising prices.
