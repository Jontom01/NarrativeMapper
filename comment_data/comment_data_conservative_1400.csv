"Had RFK Jr. been allowed to run in the DNC primary, he would have put up a strong fight against Biden and very well could have won the primary.

However, the DNC did not give RFK Jr. that chance. The party that claims they are fighting for democracy kicked him off the ballot and colluded with the media to engage in a smear campaign against him. 

The Democratic Party did not give RFK Jr. or his supporters a voice. They silenced them, censored them, threatened them, smeared them, and used dirty political tactics to keep him off the ballot to stop him and his supporters. 

The Trump campaign was the only one willing to cross ideological and party lines to talk with RFK‚Äôs campaign and his supporters. The Democrats and Kamala Harris were not.

The Democrats may act like RFK‚Äôs endorsement means nothing. But given RFK was polling around 5%, those votes are enough to give either Trump or Harris the election. RFK‚Äôs endorsement tilts the election in Trumps favor. It is a huge and crucial endorsement for Trump, even CNN has admitted this:

Our supply chain suffered greatly during COVID due to a JIT (just in time) inventory system, which is fairly common among manufacturers.

Because of this, our suppliers started seeing massive amounts of business from other companies who made a similar shift.

"Reading through both JD Vance and Tim Walz' opening paragraphs, one reads like a slam article while the other reads like praise.

Read this:

Vance has been described as a national conservative[3][4] and right-wing populist,[3][5] and he describes himself as a member of the postliberal right.[6][7] His political positions include opposition to abortion, same-sex marriage, and gun control. Vance is an outspoken critic of childlessness, linking it to sociopathy[8] and advocating that parents should have more voting power than non-parents.[9] He opposes continued American military aid to Ukraine. Vance has suggested that conservatives should use state power to forcefully re-staff institutions with ideological allies who will ""actually take a side in the culture war"".[10]

Let's see what even ChatGPT has to say about reforming this to be positive instead of negative:

https://chatgpt.com/share/dd12dd2b-4e23-4d71-b65b-ec6407205c9f

# Excerpts:

###Referencing JD Vance's last opening paragraph:

The paragraph presents a __negative direction__. It focuses on contentious political positions and actions, emphasizing opposition to widely debated issues such as abortion, same-sex marriage, and gun control. The additional references to using state power to enforce ideological conformity and increasing voting power based on parental status further suggest controversial and polarizing views. This combination of factors leans towards a portrayal that could be viewed negatively by those who oppose or are concerned by such stances.

### Referencing Tim Walz' second-to-last opening paragraph:

This paragraph has a __positive direction__. It highlights achievements and legislative successes, such as being reelected multiple times and enacting a variety of laws aimed at social improvement and safety. The inclusion of measures like free school meals, infrastructure development, and support for low-income families portrays a commitment to public welfare and progressive policies. This paints the subject in a favorable light, particularly to those who value such governmental actions.

###JD Vance's paragraph rewritten without a negative bias:

Vance is recognized as a national conservative[3][4] and right-wing populist,[3][5] and he identifies as a member of the postliberal right.[6][7] He consistently advocates for traditional values, expressing opposition to abortion, same-sex marriage, and gun control. Vance is a vocal supporter of family-focused policies, suggesting a connection between childlessness and societal issues[8] and proposing that parents be granted greater voting influence than non-parents.[9] He stands against the continuation of American military aid to Ukraine. Vance has also called for conservatives to assertively utilize state power to appoint ideological allies within key institutions, aiming to actively engage in cultural discussions.[10]

"I think you could make a very similar list from Republicans and former Trump staffers. 

A few examples:

JD Vance: called Trump ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Hitler.‚Äù

Anthony Scaramucci, former comms director: ‚ÄúHe is the domestic terrorist of the 21st century.‚Äù

Stephanie Grisham, former comms director: ‚ÄúI am terrified of him running in 2024.‚Äù

Cassidy Hutchinson, aide to chief of staff: ‚ÄúI think that Donald Trump is the most grave threat we will face to our democracy in our lifetime, and potentially in American history.‚Äù

Alberto Gonzales, AG under Bush 43: ‚ÄúDonald Trump ‚Äî perhaps the most serious threat to the rule of law in a generation.‚Äù

Just to name a few. And this is nothing of what republicans have said about Harris, Obama, Hillary, etc. 

Obviously I think politicians should always check their rhetoric. But if any of you think that the quotes in this letter are genuinely encouraging violence, you have a true disconnect from reality. 

Trump has had a very unique opportunity to use these times as a message for unity and stability in an increasingly polarized electorate. Instead, he‚Äôs using the opportunity to take cheap shots and try (seemingly succeeding here) to make his followers think that his political opponent is trying to have him killed. It‚Äôs unbecoming at the least, and untenable to the palette of those of us who remember real statesmen like Reagan, Bush, and even Obama.

The Afghan National Army was supposed to use this equipment. I don‚Äôt really blame Biden (as President) for this and not Kamala at all if you want my honest opinion. This was 20 years of failed policy. Bush, Obama and to a lesser extent Trump and Biden. Afghanistan was a lost cause from the beginning. We were never going to be able to build a nation out of people that had zero intention of being a functional country. That entire area is tribal nonsense, they do not give a shit about each other. Local commanders would just sell the supplies & fuel we would give them for personal gain for nearly two decades, not to mention, the direct CA$H. This was all reported up the chain during the Bush and Obama administrations but it wasn‚Äôt a sexy political topic.

Corruption significantly undermined the U.S. mission in Afghanistan by damaging the legitimacy of the Afghan government, strengthening popular support for the insurgency, and channeling material resources to insurgent groups. Surveys and anecdotal evidence indicate that corrupt officials at all levels of government victimized and alienated the Afghan population. Substantial U.S. funds found their way to insurgent groups, some portion of which was due to corruption. Corruption also undermined faith in the international reconstruction effort. The Afghan public witnessed limited oversight of lucrative reconstruction projects by the military and aid community, leading to bribery, fraud, extortion, and nepotism, as well as the empowerment of abusive warlords and their militias.

Tens of billions of dollars injected into the Afghan economy, combined with the limited spending capacity of the Afghan government, increased opportunities for corruption. This was exacerbated by poor oversight and contracting practices by donors and the pressure to spend budgets quickly. The amounts also exceeded the oversight capacity of the U.S. military and civilian agencies due to insecurity and lack of mobility, staffing shortages, lack of contract management expertise, and numerous layers of subcontractors who were beyond the reach of contract monitors. Not until 2010 was a more systematic effort made to address how the U.S. government itself contributed to corruption in Afghanistan.

The United States, not Republican or Democrats, failed this mission. We are a team abroad and share wins and losses together. I am afraid we are losing any sense of a unified country. That‚Äôs what makes me sad about today‚Äôs politics.",lid3hy1,conservative,1723787097.0
