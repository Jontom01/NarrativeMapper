The actual post.  
And the full text for those who can't read it:

Like many of you, I watched the debate tonight. If you haven’t already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most. As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country.  
  
Recently I was made aware that AI of ‘me’ falsely endorsing Donald Trump’s presidential run was posted to his site. It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation. It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth.  
  
I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election. I’m voting for [@ kamalaharris](https://www.instagram.com/kamalaharris/?hl=en) because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate [@timwalz](https://www.instagram.com/timwalz/?hl=en), who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman’s right to her own body for decades.  
  
I’ve done my research, and I’ve made my choice. Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make. I also want to say, especially to first time voters: Remember that in order to vote, you have to be registered! I also find it’s much easier to vote early. I’ll link where to register and find early voting dates and info in my story.  
  
With love and hope,

As of now, Harris has not agreed to anything other than the already agreed upon September 10th debate on ABC (which Trump himself subsequently backed out of).



**EDIT:** Response from the Harris team: 

*“Donald Trump is running scared and trying to back out of the debate he already agreed to and running straight to Fox News to bail him out. He needs to stop playing games and show up to the debate he already committed to on Sept 10. The Vice President will be there one way or the other to take the opportunity to speak to a prime time national audience.*

Trump is proud of the fact that he is *not normal*. We have a word for that but it escapes me at the moment.

**Edit:** And here's another thought: If Trump can't step up to Harris in a pre-arranged debate, how are we supposed to believe he'll step up to Putin if he decides to invade another country. Or if Kim Jong-Un threatens to nuke South Korea again. Or another crisis like Covid for that matter. Real leaders don't get to pick their circumstances. They either step up or step aside. They don't try to weasel out of the situation at hand and make excuses.

Biden showed up to debate even knowing he was sick and that it would reflect poorly on him. He did it anyway. He didn't complain about circumstances or try to avoid them. And when it became apparent he wasn't best suited to represent his party in November, he stepped aside in favor of someone who is.

But ABC is far more reaching than Fox News. Trump can go on Fox News any time he wants to do the townhall that the Sept 4 ""debate"" is going to turn into.

"Page 307 of [Project 2025](https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf):  Make all food labeling purely ""voluntary"" with no penalties for false or misleading food labels.

> The next Administration should: . . . **Repeal the federal labeling mandate.** The USDA should work with Congress to repeal the federal labeling law, while maintaining federal preemption, and stress that voluntary labeling is allowed.

(emphasis in original)

Every person with food allergies or specific diets will be rolling dice on any food they didn't farm and prepare 100% themselves.

Although some prefacing language says their supposed goal is simply to ""remove obstacles"" for bioengineered foods (like GMOs), the actual action recommended is a full repeal of the entire food labeling law.  No exceptions.  Maintenance of ""federal preemption"" means that no state can pass their own food labeling law in response.

The federal food labeling law is Section 403 of the FD&C Act (21 USC § 343).

> Under section 403 of the FD&C Act (21 USC § 343), **every food label must contain the name of the food, a statement of the net quantity of contents (typically net weight), and the name and address of the manufacturer or distributor**. Even today, some foods are lawfully marketed with labels that bear only these three items of information, although most labels contain more. Most notably, all but a few FDA-regulated foods must also bear a list of ingredients in descending order of predominance. The exception, however, is an important one: Foods for which FDA has established a standard of identity need not list ingredients that the standard makes mandatory.

> In addition to requiring these affirmative statements on food labels, the FD&C Act prohibits other statements; most significantly, it **prohibits statements that are false or misleading** in any particular. A related provision, section 201(n) (21 USC § 321(n)), specifies that in determining whether the labeling of a food is misleading, ""there shall be taken into account . . . not only representations made or suggested . . . but also the extent to which the labeling . . . fails to reveal facts material in light of such representations. . . ."" This was the U.S. Congress's way of recognizing that half-truths can often be as misleading as outright misrepresentations.

"***From Rolling Stone's Nikki McCann Ramirez:***

Election conspiracy theorist Tina Peters has been convicted of tampering with voting machines in Mesa County, Colorado, in the aftermath of the 2020 election. On Monday, Peters was found guilty of seven charges related to her efforts to grant unauthorized individuals access to country voting machines in order to prove false claims that the election had been fraudulently stolen from Donald Trump.

In March, Peters pleaded not guilty to 10 criminal charges, including seven felonies, in connection to a scheme to use her position as Mesa County clerk to transfer voting data from the machines to allies of former President Trump. She resigned from her role as Mesa County clerk in 2023.

Peters’ sentencing is scheduled to take place on October 3.

“This community has suffered greatly from the dishonesty, lack of transparency and refusal of Ms. Peters to take accountability,” Mesa County District Attorney Daniel P. Rubinstein said in response to the verdict. “No single elected official, or even branch of government, is above the law or should be allowed to act without those checks and balances.”

"So a recap: 

1. Elon pledges his support for Donald Trump, along with $45 million dollar donation per month to a Trump super PAC until election day.

2. Elon throttles the number of followers for Kamala Harris' twitter account, preventing more people from seeing her latest tweets. 

3. Elon Musk puts his own tweets as top priority in the algorithm, so you always see his tweets regardless if you follow him or not.


4. Elon shares a fake Kamala Harris political ad that was AI generated and got over 120 million views.

6. Elon bans White Dudes for Harris because they were drawing in money for Harris' campaign. 

7. Elon regularly allows hate speech (like racism and misogyny) on his platform and allows it to be used against individuals he doesn't like, such as Kamala Harris. When negative posts are directed at him over proven facts, such as the nature of his family fortune, those users are banned because ""defamation is not free speech."" So in Elon's mind, it's okay to spew hate speech against groups of people or against individuals he doesn't like, but not him. 

8. Elon shares and comments on anti-vaccine disinformation and blames Democrats.

9. Elon continues to tweet and retweet anti-LGBT rhetoric and misogyny, and treats his bigotry and opinions as facts while banning others who try to support LGBT individuals, including his own daughter.

"It continues. Six days ago, *The New York Times* [ran a story](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/10/us/politics/trump-campaign-election.html) under the headline “Inside the Worst Three Weeks of Donald Trump’s 2024 Campaign.” Usually, when the country’s most important newspaper runs a story like that, the candidate pays a little attention and the ship begins to right itself. But in this case, it’s just gotten worse. The ship is capsizing, and the captain is losing his marbles.

Right after that story ran, Trump came out with his wild accusation that Kamala Harris’s crowd of thousands at a Detroit airplane hangar was fake. The next night, he did that weird, to borrow an au courant word, interview with Elon Musk, where he made more WTF comments than I can recount, capped by his vow to move to Venezuela (a country ruled by a corrupt autocrat who just cheated massively in this month’s election) if he loses. On Wednesday, he gave a rambling speech at a North Carolina rally.

Then, on Thursday, we had a little taste of some [peak Trump crazy](https://newrepublic.com/post/184939/donald-trump-derails-press-conference-campaign-strategy). He claimed Harris is responsible for [a law in California](https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-160551360299) that says [it’s OK to steal](https://x.com/atrupar/status/1824188075989155864) from a grocery store as long as your take is under $950.

He made strange comments about Cheerios. He lectured Jews (at a later event) about how if the Democrats win, Jewish people “don’t have a chance” in America, [saying of Harris](https://www.katv.com/news/beyond-the-podium/jewish-voices-for-trump-coalition-formed-to-combat-antisemitism-2024-presidential-election-politics)—whose husband is Jewish—that “she doesn’t like Jewish people. You know it, I know it, and everybody knows it, and nobody wants to say it.” And we can’t forget the assertion that more than 100 percent of recent U.S. jobs have gone to migrants.

Meanwhile, what else is Harris doing? Starting to unveil an economic package that, so far anyway, looks pretty great. It’s aimed straight at middle-class voters and focused on housing and grocery prices. You can’t get more kitchen table than that. And the bit about [going after corporate price gougers](https://newrepublic.com/article/184937/harris-price-gouging-corporations) is great. It sends a nice populist signal that she’s willing to make some enemies.

We’re coming up on a month now of Harris being the candidate. That isn’t much time, granted, and of course the race is still in margin-of-error territory and at some point

But all that said, the Harris campaign has been as shrewd as any presidential campaign I’ve ever seen. Her stump speech is excellent. The choice of Walz was great—their personal chemistry is so evident in that video they just released of the two of them chatting about spicy food and whatnot (the right is trying to gin up outrage over Walz saying he eats “white-guy tacos”).

The response to the letter was more than passing strange. Other mental health professionals rose to denounce the letter and its signatories. One was Allen Frances, the prestigious chairman of the task force that wrote the “Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV”, considered psychiatry’s diagnostic bible. Dr Frances had two problems with the letter. The first was, he said, that Trump was too successful to be mentally ill – a bizarre argument that sounded like one Trump would make himself. “Mr. Trump,” Dr. Frances intoned, “causes severe distress rather than experiencing it and has been richly rewarded, rather than punished, for his grandiosity, self-absorption and lack of empathy.” 

Therefore Trump could not possibly be mentally ill, Frances concluded, apparently unaware of erratic politicians in world history who have achieved success in the exact terms defined by their insanity. Frances added, with an apparently unintentional touch of humour, that pronouncing Trump mentally ill was an insult to the mentally ill.

Reacting to the negative backlash, the Times then published an article about the controversy by Richard Friedman, a psychiatrist. Friedman referred to what is known in American psychiatry as the Goldwater rule. This was the American Psychiatric Association’s official prohibition against mental health professionals making a public diagnosis of a politician’s mental health. That edict itself was a response to mental health professionals participating, in 1964, in a public survey and judging then Republican candidate for president, Barry Goldwater, mentally unfit to be president. Siding with the APA, Friedman finished by declaring that clinically judging Trump to be mentally ill would let him “off the moral hook”. And from that point on, liberal attacks on Trump were unfailingly moral, a tactic that soon degenerated into a grossly ineffectual torrent of moral hubris, virtue-mongering and sanctimony.

There are, of course, sound reasons to resist declaring Trump mentally unsound. At this late moment in American civilisation, the concept of mental illness is nearly impossible to clarify. When I wrote, in 2017, about the dust-up over whether Trump should be publicly diagnosed, my very own therapist at the time paused in the middle of one of our sessions to scold me for doing so. The weapon of psychological stigma can be used, like impeachment, against any rival or adversary. In 2011, a psychologist named Drew Westen enraged people by publishing, again in the Times, a lengthy essay arguing, in effect, that Obama did not have the “character” to be president (a “deep-seated aversion to conflict”; “tic-like gestures of compromise”).

It could well be that the debate over whether it was acceptable to call Trump mentally unfit to be president is at the heart of the weird debate over who is more weird, the Democrats or the Republicans. America is becoming unrecognisable, so fast, in so many ways, to so many different types of people, that the words “weird” and “sick” are being anxiously domesticated into neutral terms of description. Yet, in the end, the unclarity is all the more reason to be vigilant about truly aberrant figures slipping into leadership of the country under the cover of a revolution of norms. Trump is truly aberrant. Everyone knows it, his supporters as much as his detractors. No one talks like this man. No one abuses other people like this man. No one misrepresents reality like this man. And he is not lying. He is describing what he perceives, which is not what is actually there.

Biden’s relational skills, his empathy, his moral perception of reality were never the issue. He had been, by all appearances and accounts, a mentally stable man all his life. That is why his cognitive decline became so apparent, once his entourage stopped shielding him. It is harder to discern Trump’s cognitive decline, because his behaviour, ironically, serves the same purpose as Biden’s entourage, obscuring the decline it is a symptom of. But anyone watching him abruptly change subjects in his acceptance speech at the Republican convention, anyone who listened to that speech and watched him disappear into the rabbit hole of his own mind, can see that he is even further along in his deterioration than Biden.

The liberal media cried wolf in 2016, and now they are afraid to ring the alarm bells when it is vital to ring them. After January 6 and the spectacle of watching the effects of Trump’s “personal myth of greatness” being challenged, now is the time to apply the same scrutiny of Trump’s mental condition that was applied to Biden – the appearance of throwing stones from glass houses be damned. Having been criticised for questioning Trump’s sanity in 2017, and despite the daily evidence that Trump’s faculties are clearly degenerating, the ferociously partisan liberal press wishes to present itself as dignified and above the fray. Yet what was good for the octogenarian gander with declining faculties but an intact moral centre should be equally good for the septuagenarian gander with declining faculties and a pathologically absent moral centre. The great blessing in life, and the great curse, is that people can get used to just about anything.

Pennsylvania polling uses a larger sample size which tightens the race though Trump still leads in registered and likely voters when it's a head to head match up between Trump and Biden.  With RFK Jr included that lead switches to Biden marginally leading Trump.

Michigan polling shows Trump leading again in a head to head match but, like Pennsylvania, Biden marginally leads Trump with RFK Jr included.

"It’s about time. In the decades since Nixon began the War On Drugs as a way to remove voting rights from brown people and young people, America has become a nation of for profit prisons, with a majority of those prisoners doing time for non-violent drug crimes.

**Edit:** Nixon created DEA in 1973, ostensibly because of Americas huge drug problem at the time. For reference, there were 6,413 heroin overdose deaths in the US in 1973 (population  was 210,284,000). Not sure if that qualifies as a huge problem compared to alcohol or cigarettes, but that's just my opinion.

My comment, **which should have said brown people and young people AKA ""hippies""** was more spurred by John Ehrlichman's (Nixon's domestic policy advisor) statements from a 2016 Harper's cover story which described Nixon's plan:

""... by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.""

So, ruining people's lives has always been a core part of the War On Drugs (see Mandatory Minimum Sentencing). The voting thing was just a bonus. I should have been more specific.

"> In her dissent, Sotomayor wrote that the majority’s opinion will now protect this exact type of conduct.

>“The president of the United States is the most powerful person in the country, and possibly the world,” wrote Sotomayor. “When he uses his official powers in any way, under the majority’s reasoning, he now will be insulated from criminal prosecution. Orders the Navy’s Seal Team 6 to assassinate a political rival? Immune. Organizes a military coup to hold onto power? Immune. Takes a bribe in exchange for a pardon? Immune. Immune, immune, immune.”

edit: from the majority:

>(3) Presidents cannot be indicted based on conduct for which they are immune from prosecution. On remand, the District Court must carefully analyze the indictment’s remaining allegations to determine whether they too involve conduct for which a President must be immune from prosecution. And the parties and the District Court must ensure that sufficient allegations support the indictment’s charges without such conduct. **Testimony or private records of the President or his advisers probing such conduct may not be admitted as evidence at trial.** Pp. 30–32

An incredible amount of evidence of a president's criminal acts are inadmissible to the Supreme Court! What this means:

>Finally, Roberts does concede that the president may be prosecuted for “unofficial” acts. So, for example, if Trump had personally attempted to shoot and kill then-presidential candidate Joe Biden in the lead-up to the 2020 election, rather than ordering a subordinate to do so, then Trump could probably be prosecuted for murder.

>But even this caveat to Roberts’s sweeping immunity decision is not very strong. Roberts writes that “in dividing official from unofficial conduct, courts may not inquire into the President’s motives.” And Roberts even limits the ability of prosecutors to pursue a president who accepts a bribe in return for committing an official act, such as pardoning a criminal who pays off the president. In Roberts’s words, a prosecutor may not “admit testimony or private records of the President or his advisers probing the official act itself.”

>That means that, [while the president can be prosecuted for an “unofficial” act, the prosecutors may not prove that he committed this crime using evidence drawn from the president’s “official” actions.](https://www.vox.com/scotus/358292/supreme-court-trump-immunity-dictatorship)

>The practical implications of this ruling are astounding. As Justice Sonia Sotomayor writes in a dissenting opinion, “imagine a President states in an official speech that he intends to stop a political rival from passing legislation that he opposes, no matter what it takes to do so,” it follows from Roberts’s opinion that the ensuing murder indictment “could include no allegation of the President’s public admission of premeditated intent to support” the proposition that the president intended to commit murder.",lb4w5j4,politics,1719846115.0

A total of 468 seats in the U.S. Congress are up for election! That’s 33 seats in the [Senate](https://ballotpedia.org/United_States_Senate_elections,_2024) 
and all 435 in the [House of Representatives](https://ballotpedia.org/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2024)

We have 9 districts out here in Arizona, 9 seats. Know your district. Know who’s running in your district and how they voted in the past. Who pays for the campaigns. All that info is public and in the links. This year it’s important to know a few things before checking that box.

* Eli Crane of Arizona D2
* Andy Biggs of Arizona D5
* Debbie Lesko of Arizona D8
* Paul Gosar of Arizona D9

We have one senate seat up this year. Looking to represent Arizona is Ruben Gallego or Mark Lamb. Make sure the person representing Arizona best represents you! 
[Senate election in Arizona 2024](https://ballotpedia.org/United_States_Senate_election_in_Arizona,_2024)

[Mark Lamb](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Lamb_(sheriff)) is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and became American law-enforcement Sheriff in 2017.

He wrote American Sheriff: Traditional Values in a Modern World. Lamb is a supporter of the Stop the Steal movement. He spoke at a rally where he said the riot was not Trump's fault but rather caused by ""the other issues that have happened – the Hillary Clintons that have gone unpunished"".He later described the rioters as ""very loving, Christian people.""

In 2020, Lamb spoke at a convention of the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, an organization that holds the fringe legal theory that sheriffs are the supreme legal authority in the United States and are not required to enforce laws they believe to be unconstitutional.

[Ruben Gallego](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruben_Gallego) 3rd Battalion, 25th Marines. Attended Harvard University and earned a Bachelor of Arts in international relations. 

His first successful bill passed in 2011 it granted in-state tuition status to veterans residing in Arizona. Gallego supported the repeal of Arizona SB 1070. He wrote They Called Us ""Lucky"": The Life and Afterlife of the Iraq War's Hardest Hit Unit, published in 2021. 

Gallego founded the group Citizens for Professional Law Enforcement with the goal of recalling Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, citing Arpaio's immigration policies and his use of taxpayer money to investigate Barack Obama's citizenship.

We have two seats in the [Arizona Supreme Court](https://ballotpedia.org/Arizona_Supreme_Court_elections,_2024) up for election on November 5, 2024. The Justices up for retention election are Clint Bolick and Kathryn Hackett King. If retained, they will serve six year terms. Gov. Doug Ducey (R) appointed both justices to the supreme court.

"The last few days could not have been any more of a nightmare for Trump world, given how unexpectedly well-executed this pivot has been for the Democrats. I don't think anyone predicted it could go this well:

* Dems have immediately unified behind Harris and practically ended their infighting. Any cracks in the first 48 hours could have been fatal, but it's clear that the party is rock solid behind this.
* Harris is much improved as a speaker compared to even a few years ago, and is ready to meet the moment, and serve as a perfect foil for the opponent she is facing. Her initial speeches have been well received, and she's already hit on a slogan that's resonating with voters (""We're not going back"").
* The Democrat base has done a complete 180, and is now super energised and raring to go. Trump is relying on demoralised Dem voters and depressed turnout to win. This is the single biggest threat to Trump, more so than any individual candidate, and could well prove fatal for him if Dems can keep this momentum going to election day.
* Harris has managed to raise a huge amount of money in just a couple of days. The Trump campaign had *just* caught up with Biden in campaign funds, and are now lagging behind again.
* Trump is going to have to waste a good chunk of that money redoing his entire campaign, because it was fully geared around shitting on Biden specifically, rather than promoting any positive message about Trump (because there simply isn't one).
* The GOP apparently did not prepare for this scenario at all, despite egging it on for a long time, and are struggling to align on a narrative against Harris.
* Any possible bounce from the shooting and RNC has been wiped out by coverage of Biden>Harris. That Trump didn't really get a bounce from the shooting suggests he has hit probably his hard ceiling, meanwhile Harris is starting from a roughly even position with him with plenty of room to grow.
* Trump's arrogance led him to think he had the election in the bag, and has now lumbered himself with a strategically poor and unpopular VP pick.

There's still a monumental task ahead, and it's absolutely not going to be a sure thing, but I don't think the past couple of days could have gone any better for Kamala Harris.

"No surprise that Trump supporters, who are attacking Harris for the border, have no idea what she was actually tasked to do:

- In March 2021, when the Biden administration faced the early stages of an influx in illegal crossings at the U.S. southern border, Mr. Biden tasked Harris with leading the administration's diplomatic campaign to address the ""root causes"" of migration from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, including poverty, corruption and violence.

- In her immigration role, Harris' main line of work has focused on convincing companies to invest in Central America and promoting democracy and development there through diplomacy. In March of this year, the White House announced Harris had secured a commitment from the private sector to invest over $5 billion to promote economic opportunities and reduce violence in the region.

- In fiscal year 2023, for example, Border Patrol apprehensions of migrants from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador made up 22% of all crossings during that time period, down from 41% in fiscal year 2021, government statistics show.

Gov. Tim Walz on Wednesday agreed to participate in a vice presidential debate hosted by CBS News on Oct. 1 in New York City.

Former President Donald Trump's campaign has not yet agreed to the date, leaving GOP Sen. JD Vance's participation in question. 

Earlier in the day, CBS News proposed four dates for a debate between the two vice presidential nominees: Sept. 17, Sept. 24, Oct. 1, and Oct. 8. The Harris-Walz campaign soon agreed to the Oct. 1 date.

""See you on October 1, JD,"" Walz wrote on X.

A date for the vice presidential debate has been in limbo since the spring, when CBS News first extended the invitation to both presidential campaigns. In May, President Biden's campaign said Vice President Kamala Harris, who was still his running mate at the time, was willing to face off against the eventual Republican vice presidential nominee on either July 23 or Aug. 13.

The Constitution says, quite clearly, that Congress passes laws and the president enforces them.

"The point I’ve been making is that a lot of what we dislike now - the inflation, the housing prices, the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, and so on - where we’re rightfully angry at Biden for not doing more or doing the right thing: a lot of it is happening *now* because we let Trump win in 2016.

Trump weakened NATO and gave Putin the green light to invade Ukraine. Trump sided with Netanyahu and helped to kettle the Palestinians, pulled out of the Iran deal, alienated the Iranian regime by assassinating a high-level official, and set the stage that led to Hamas’s attack on Israel. Trump juiced interest rates during a growing economy and handed out tax cuts for the rich, and those bills are coming due now. He pulled out of the Paris Accords and severely undermined the global effort to fight climate change. 

So here we are. Things suck, but they suck *because of Trump*. Things suck because we as a nation decided that Hillary didn’t “deserve” the job, wasn’t likeable or inspiring, didn’t run a good campaign. We told ourselves that Trump and Hillary were basically the same, so we voted for protest candidates or stayed home. And now we have a genocide in Gaza. People are right to be angry about the things Biden isn’t doing that he could definitely be doing *today* to put an end to it. But we wouldn’t even be here if we had made Hillary president when we had the chance.

Biden could be doing a better job of handling the suck, but it is *virtually guaranteed* that a second Trump term will only bring us back to where we are now, in another several years. Trump will wreck the economy to serve his interests, he’ll weaken America on the global stage, and then we’ll vote him out - only to be frustrated again that the guy after him *also* doesn’t solve all the issues Trump caused.

"You know what, here is the op-ed:

>*Jim Parrott is co-owner of Parrott Ryan Advisors and a nonresident fellow at the Urban Institute. Mark Zandi is chief economist of Moody’s Analytics.*

>The cost of housing has rarely been higher or more painful for so many Americans. Since the pandemic hit, rents are up about 20 percent, forcing half of all renters to spend more than 30 percent of their monthly income on rent, the highest number on record. And with home prices up 50 percent and mortgage rates up almost 100 percent, the monthly payment for a median-priced house has more than doubled, from $1,000 to $2,250. A home that was affordable only a few years ago is well out of reach now.

>The strain this is putting on families is doing significant damage to the economy. If not for the ever-increasing cost of housing, inflation would have returned to the Federal Reserve’s target almost a year ago, and it would have long since begun cutting interest rates. It’s a serious impediment to savings, making it difficult for many to cover everyday expenses, much less save for their kids’ college or a down payment on a home. And it constrains labor mobility, making the economy less resilient against shocks.

>The cause of the rising cost of housing is not a mystery: We simply don’t have enough affordable homes for rent or for sale. We have enough homes at the top of the market — homes that wealthy families can afford. But we don’t have enough homes for sale that aspiring homeowners can afford, or enough to rent that working families can afford. We estimate that, all told, the nation is short approximately 3 million homes, almost entirely in the bottom half of the market.

>Given this unmet demand, why haven’t developers built more of these homes? Because the numbers don’t add up. For a mix of reasons dating back to the financial crisis and worsened by the pandemic, the cost of land, labor and materials has risen to levels that make it all but impossible for most builders to make an adequate profit on affordable housing.

>The solution is to change these economics.

>This is at the heart of the housing proposal released last week by Vice President Kamala Harris, which lays out a set of tax breaks with which the numbers for building affordable housing would finally pencil out.

>To incentivize building affordable rental housing, Harris would expand a tax break for developers known as the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit. LIHTC has been a critical source of financing for affordable rental housing for almost 40 years. While it is not perfect — not all of the subsidy goes into units that would not otherwise be built — it has broad political support, can be scaled up quickly and distributes the tax break equitably nationwide.

>Harris also proposes creating a comparable tax break for builders to address the shortfall in affordable homes for purchase. Policymakers have largely ignored this shortfall, focusing instead on demand-side support for homeownership that alone would do little to help in a supply-constrained market such as the one we have today. Under the new proposal, home builders would get a tax break on profits made from homes built and sold to first-time home buyers. As with LITHC, this would increase the returns for builders and developers to focus on the lower-income side of the market.

>Finally, Harris proposes a new tax credit for renovating homes that can’t be sold for enough to cover the cost of repairing them. This would help bring to the market homes long languishing in neighborhoods that have fallen into disrepair.

>These three moves would provide enough incentive for developers to tackle the supply shortfall across much of the country. In some areas, however, lack of infrastructure or political ambivalence over the additional density needed would still stand in the way. Harris thus proposes significant funds for states and communities to overcome local hurdles to building more affordable housing, making it easier for communities to get behind the projects needed to make up the shortfall.

>Each of these moves would be meaningful on its own, but together they would amount to the most aggressive supply-side push since the national investment in housing that followed World War II. As one would expect from an effort of this scale, it is not cheap. The supply-side measures in Harris’s proposal would cost an estimated $125 billion, a hefty tab that must be paid with spending cuts or taxes, since adding to the federal deficit would drive up mortgage rates and undermine the very housing affordability effort it’s paying for.

>*Any effort* adequate to the scale of this challenge will be expensive, however, and pale in comparison to the long-term cost of letting the nation’s housing shortfall deepen. Our lack of affordable housing will continue to depress savings, opportunity and growth in ways that will do long-term harm to the nation’s economy. A thoughtful effort to address the problem now will ultimately lead to more growth and less cost.

>For all the controversy Harris’s plan will likely generate in an election year, it is precisely the sort of effort needed, both in its scope and its design. Indeed, it is one that both sides of the aisle should eventually find appealing, as it marshals the resources of the private sector to tackle a public policy challenge that plagues red and blue states alike. By making it economical to build the housing we need, it would finally end the decade-long shortfall, easing rents and home prices and the daunting weight that these ever-rising costs are putting on the nation’s economy.",ljs1wxk,politics,1724541599.0

How could Democrats do this?


\==========================


Edit:  because I'm tired of these BS replies claiming he's antifa or a Democrat.

Here's the evidence we have right now:

His donation was $15 to a progressive voter turnout group on the day of Biden's inauguration (Jan 20, 2021) when he was 17. It was to one of those spam email donation links and could have been anything: a bet lost, a misunderstanding that the group was progressive and not general get out the vote, a legit donation, who knows?

[Donation](https://i.imgur.com/eF46TzP.jpeg)

[An article discussing the donation](https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/trumps-shooter-gave-15-to-a-progressive)

TLDR: spam donation, may have just confused him as a get out the vote thing.  He unsubscribed from them later.

Regardless, he registered Sept 28, 2021, 8 months later, as a Republican to vote in the 2022 midterms, which he did.  Note that he didn't register for the primary.  It was well before that.  We don't even have evidence he voted in the primary. This implies he didn't though (last vote date Nov 8, 2022).

[Registration](https://i.imgur.com/f6LNDXk.jpeg)

We also have accounts of his classmates saying he was deeply conservative. 

[Inquirer Article](https://www.inquirer.com/news/pennsylvania/thomas-matthew-crooks-trump-shooter-id-butler-20240714.html)

> Former student Max R. Smith remembered Crooks as an intelligent classmate with conservative political leanings. Smith recalled participating in a mock debate in a course they took together, where their teacher posed questions on government policy and had students stand on opposite sides of the classroom to signal their support or opposition.

> “The majority of the class were on the liberal side, but Tom, no matter what, always stood his ground on the conservative side,” Smith said. “That’s still the picture I have of him. Just standing alone on one side while the rest of the class was on the other. ... It makes me wonder why he would carry out an assassination attempt on the conservative candidate.”

He also had a Demolition Ranch shirt on.  They're not strictly political, but their audience skews heavily conservative due to the focus on 2A stuff.


It's not 100% known what his political beliefs were as he had a low social media presence (don't buy the ones you're seeing until it's confirmed, there were so many fake accounts made right after the shooting), but the current evidence points more strongly towards him being a legit Republican.

I've seen better vamping from the kid whose giving a report of ""How to kill a mockingbird"" and all he has to work with is the book title. At least it was amusing to hear different ways to kill said mockingbird and the look of anger/abhorrence on the teacher's face.",llo4kf6,politics,1725561449.0
">If you listened, though, there was some news here. Musk — who did a glitchy, podcast-style [interview](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/what-did-elon-musk-ask-donald-trump.html) with Trump where he bragged about firing employees — has apparently agreed to head a commission that would root out what Trump calls government fraud and abuse. Government waste, particularly in the form of fraudulent spending, is in fact a major problem in the budget, with the Government Accountability Office estimating that it reaches [more than $500 billion a year](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-105833#:~:text=We%20estimated%20that%20the%20federal,is%20required%20to%20address%20it.). (Trump’s plan is similar to the GAO’s Biden-era approach for rooting it out.) The Musk-led commission, if it ever happens, would supposedly save “trillions” of dollars over an unspecified period.

>Trump also pledged to cut ten regulations for every one that passes — a five-fold increase from a 2016 pledge. He also cycled through a few promises that he’s made in the past, such as cutting taxes for Social Security benefits and corporate research and development, increasing oil drilling in the U.S., and, maybe, [locking up Harris](https://x.com/atrupar/status/1831736453484662948). Hard to tell if he was actually serious about that last one or if he was just trying to get his audience to wake up.

So the policies are: 

(1) Put Musk in charge of a Trump version of the Government Accountability Office

(2) Attack regulations that protect workers, consumers, and the environment

(3) Cut taxes (i.e., cut programs that rely on those taxes) on Social Security and Corporate R&D

(4) Increase the amount of oil and gas leases (in the hopes that it will bring down energy costs \[note: it won't\])

(5) Weaponize the Justice Department against political enemies

"A bit from the commentary:

> the court's corruption is deeply intertwined with the bad decisions that are inflicting harm on millions of people. This is why I was pleased to see Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. file articles of impeachment against Thomas and Alito this week, accusing them of ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" for hiding the millions of dollars of gifts received from billionaires. She's also charged them for not recusing from election-related cases, despite substantial evidence that they and their wives have insurrectionist sympathies. Despite her strong social media presence and lefty credentials, Ocasio-Cortez has earned a reputation as a serious leader and not one prone to cheap political stunts. She wouldn't be doing this if she weren't serious, even though she fully admits it will go nowhere in a GOP-dominated House. 
> 
> It's also a big deal, because Ocasio-Cortez is known for being a nuts-and-bolts politician. While she is conversant in more abstract topics, she's celebrated for her skill at explaining, in an accessible way, how economic and health care policy impacts people's lives. She has been one of the most effective elected officials speaking out against Dobbs, for instance. This is precisely why she's the perfect person to take the lead in keeping the corruption story alive. She's well-positioned to explain how elite corruption is a big reason why the Supreme Court keeps issuing dangerous opinions that hurt ordinary people.
> 
> In her speech introducing the articles, Ocasio-Cortez drew a direct line between the corruption of Thomas and Alito and ""the suffering of the American people."" She argued that we cannot ""pretend that this corruption is wholly unrelated to the pregnant Americans now suffering and bleeding out in emergency rooms"" because of the Dobbs decision penned by Alito. After all, Ocasio-Cortez noted, banning abortion was a ""key political priority of these undisclosed benefactors and shadow organizations surrounding Alito and Thomas's misconduct.""",lctegxr,politics,1720781589.0

Almost 40,000 people registered to vote in the 48 hours after President Biden announced he was suspending his reelection campaign and endorsing Vice President Harris, Vote.org said.

Vote.org said 38,500 new voters registered, representing the largest number of registrations in a 48-hour period this election cycle.

Of the new voter registrations, 83 percent were from people aged 18-34, according to the voting registration nonprofit group.“
