# NarrativeMapper


## Overview

NarrativeMapper is a discourse analysis tool that extracts dominant narratives and emotional tone from online communities using:

- OpenAI Embeddings ([OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings))

- Dimensionality reduction ([UMAP](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/))

- Density-based clustering ([HDBSCAN](https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/))

- Topic Summary + sentiment extraction ([OpenAI's Chat Completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt), model gpt-4o-mini + [Hugging Face's distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english))


## Installation and Setup

**Installation:**

Install via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/NarrativeMapper/): 

```bash
pip install NarrativeMapper
```

**Setup:**

1. Create a .env file in your root directory (same folder where your script runs).

2. Inside the .env file, add your OpenAPI key like this:

```dotenv
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

The package will automatically load your key using python-dotenv. (Make sure to keep your .env file private and add it to your .gitignore if you're using Git.)


## Output Formats

This example is based off of 1800 r/antiwork comments from the top 300 posts within the last year (Date of Writing: 2025-04-03).

The three formatter functions return the following:

**format_to_dict()** returns dict, useful for JSON export.

```json
{
    "online_group_name": "r/antiwork",
    "clusters": [
        {
            "cluster": 0,
            "cluster_summary": "The core theme of this cluster revolves around the frustrations and challenges of the modern job application and interview process, highlighting issues such as discrimination, exploitative practices, and the disconnect between employers and candidates.",
            "tone": "NEGATIVE",
            "comment_count": 76
        },

        },
        {
            "cluster": 6,
            "cluster_summary": "The comments express strong criticism of capitalism, highlighting themes of exploitation, corporate greed, and the detrimental impact of billionaires and CEOs on workers and society.",
            "tone": "NEGATIVE",
            "comment_count": 89
        }
    ]
} 
```

## How to Use

**Option 1: High-Level Class-Based Interface**

```python
from narrative_mapper import *

#initialize NarrativeMapper object
mapper = NarrativeMapper("r/antiwork")

#embeds semantic vectors
mapper.load_embeddings("path/to/your/file.csv", chunk_size=1000)

#clustering: n_components, n_neighbors are UMAP variables. min_cluser_size, min_samples are HDBSCAN variables.
mapper.cluster(n_components=20, n_neighbors=20, min_cluster_size=40, min_samples=15)

#summarize each cluster's topic and sentiment
mapper.summarize(max_sample_size=500)

#export in your preferred format
summary_dict = mapper.format_to_dict()
text_df = mapper.format_by_text()
cluster_df = mapper.format_by_cluster()

#saving DataFrames to csv
text_df.to_csv("comments_by_cluster.csv", index=False)
cluster_df.to_csv("cluster_summary.csv", index=False)
```

**Option 2: Low-Level Functional Interface**

```python
from narrative_mapper import *

#manual control over each step:
embeddings = get_embeddings("path/to/your/file.csv", chunk_size=1000)
cluster_df = cluster_embeddings(embeddings, n_components=20, n_neighbors=20, min_cluster_size=40, min_samples=15)
summary_df = summarize_clusters(cluster_df, max_sample_size=500)

#export/format options
summary_dict = format_to_dict(summary_df, online_group_name="r/antiwork")
text_df = format_by_text(summary_df, online_group_name="r/antiwork")
cluster_df = format_by_cluster(summary_df, online_group_name="r/antiwork")
```

## Pipeline Architecture & API Overview

**Pipeline:**

```txt
CSV Text Data → Embeddings → Clustering → Summarization → Formatting
```
**Functions:**

```python

#Converts each message into a 3072-dimensional vector using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large.
get_embeddings(file_path, chunk_size=...)

#Clusters the embeddings using UMAP (for reduction) and HDBSCAN (for density-based clustering).
cluster_embeddings(embeddings, n_components=..., n_neighbors=..., min_cluster_size=..., min_samples=...)

#Uses GPT (via Chat Completions) to label clusters and Hugging Face for sentiment analysis.
summarize_clusters(clustered_df, max_sample_size=...)

#Returns structured output as a dictionary (ideal for JSON export).
format_to_dict(summary_df)

#Returns a DataFrame where each row summarizes a cluster.
format_by_cluster(summary_df)

#Returns a DataFrame where each row is an individual comment with its sentiment and cluster label.
format_by_text(summary_df)

```
### NarrativeMapper Class

**Instance Attributes:**

        self.online_group_name     # Name of the online community or data source
        self.embeddings            # List of dicts with original text + 3072-dim embedding
        self.cluster_df            # DataFrame after clustering
        self.summary_df            # DataFrame after summarization

```

**Methods:**

```

### Parameter Reference

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to expand</strong></summary>

- **n_components**: The number of dimensions UMAP reduces the embedding vectors to. Lower values simplify the data for clustering.

- **n_neighbors**: Influences UMAP’s balance between local and global structure. Higher values emphasize global relationships.

- **min_cluster_size**: In HDBSCAN, the minimum number of points required to form a cluster. Smaller values allow more granular clusters.

- **min_samples**: A density sensitivity parameter in HDBSCAN. Higher values make clustering more conservative.

- **chunk_size** *(load_embeddings)*: Number of messages processed per API request to avoid token limits. Choose smaller values the larger your textual messages are.

- **max_sample_size** *(summarize)*: Maximum number of comments sampled per cluster for summarization.

## Open API Pricing

Estimated cost: **$0.13 to $0.28 per 1 million tokens**.

Example: A CSV containing 1,000 Reddit comments costs approximately **$0.01** to process.

<details>
<summary><strong>Click for pricing details</strong></summary>

The OpenAI text-embedding-3-large model costs approximately $13 per 1 million input tokens. Determined by the total tokens of your input textual messages.

The Chat Completions model used for summarization (gpt-4o-mini) is $15 per 1 million input tokens. The max_sample_size parameter (referenced later) helps reduce costs by limiting how many comments are passed into gpt-4o-mini for each cluster. This can significantly reduce the Chat Completions token usage.

The gpt-4o-mini input prompt (excluding the text) and output summary are both very short (<100 tokens), so their cost contribution is negligible.
