Your job is a narcissist, your value to it is inherently tied to how much of yourself youre willing and able to give.  And like a narcissist, no matter what you give, it will never be enough.  Because when you boil it down, the purpose of most jobs is simply to make as much money as quickly as possible for the boss.  And since your boss will never have enough money and it will never come fast enough, nothing you do will ever be enough for them.  Come in on a weekend to catch up?  Your job will start expecting that all the time and will grow ""concerned about your motivation"" if you dont do it.  Answer an email after hours?  The next time you don't, they are ""concerned about your dedication"".  Do double the work to fill in for someone who's on leave or for an open position?  The second you assert boundaries or express concern about this, you arent ""being a team player"".  Use vacation time that is allocated to you?  They'll question your ""priorities"" and ""commitments"".  Surpass whatever financial goals or performance metrics they set for you?  Great!  Now next month double it!  and if you don't...""we're concerned about your devotion and consistency"".  Get verbally abused by a boss and stand up for yourself? If they dont fire you on the spot, ""we're concerned about the cultural fit"".  

And like a narcissist, if you dont like the way you're being treated, its your fault.  If you just worked harder your job wouldnt have to punish you.  If you worked as hard as your boss and were as smart as him, you too would be rich and could tell other people what to do so you can get whatever you want.  But you're not rich, and its your fault, its because you didnt work hard enough.

If you clock in and out frequently at odd times and say miss a day of work for unpaid leave it‚Äôs (ever so slightly) harder to figure out exactly when to clock in and out for the next week to make it up (yes it‚Äôs a like 1 min calculation but the software doesnt support this kind of thing so a manager would have to do this calculation themselves) you need 8hrs but can only work ‚Äú9a-5p‚Äù but the system will round you off if you clock in a few mins early and a few mins late so the manager needs to determine when you can clock in and out to make sure your 40hrs don‚Äôt get affected by this rounding ‚Ä¶.","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9948170781135559}"

This happened to me once. I made $13/hr+tips running a food truck at a popular bar. Took home about $1300/week +cash between hourly/ot/ and electronic tips. I ran the food to people's tables so a lot of people gave me 20%. It was just me in the truck. So the boss fires me, says she'll give me the deposit in 2 weeks. I tell her no, you'll do it in 24 hours because that's texas law. She said thats not true and got condescending about me being a cook vs her being a business owner (2 pyramid schemes and a failing food truck all wasting her husbands money) and after exchanged insults  I sent her a screenshot of the TX law. The next day, I get a check for like, $300. I ask her where the fuck the rest of it is and she sends me a screenshot of TX ""tip credit law"" and  says something like ""this is a lesson to you about your attitude and thinking youre so smart, you're a cook not a business owner for a reason"" she told me tip credit meant she could pay me 5 an hour and only give me enough of the tips to make 7.25 and the business keeps the rest of the tips.  She admitted to 2 crimes through text.I demanded my owed money and the data from the register, for the entire time i worked there, and threw many more insults. Said if she didn't, I would call the state labor commission and the cops. Because wage theft is civil and criminal in texas.  After a condescending and directly insulting lesson from me on how tip credits work and changing pay rates were illegal. She said she would call her lawyer and have him call me to explain that she was right.

Under an hour later I get a text that says ""please check your account and let me know if the money has made it, if not I will cancel the deposit and get you a check by the end of the day"" and then sent me all the paystub math and all the register data. I got really sarcastic about her call to the lawyer. I bet he flipped the fuck out hearing her admitting to multiple crimes.

I decided to make an international call to the east coast of Canada to tell them I couldn't show up unless they wanted to reimburse me for a week's worth of an overseas trip plus airfare. 

Apparently he didn't check the blockout book. I still wish I could have seen the long distance charge for that call.

Then my last few days there I was scheduled for the end of that week. I couldn't call but whatever , I should be back home by then right? WRONG. Get turned around halfway from Toronto and the rescheduled flight was cancelled the next morning. The 2nd rescheduled flight wasn't supposed to leave until Wednesday meaning I wouldn't be home until Thursday morning at the earliest. 

I had to make another long distance call (this time I was getting charged too rip) asking them what they were doing as the store manager said she wouldn't schedule me until the week AFTER I came back. I basically told them the  situation and that Thursday morning's shift was an automatic no-go, as was Friday's. They insisted on Saturday and i told them there was a good chance that our flights may get cancelled AGAIN and that the SM assured me I wouldn't be scheduled until I got back. Managers got pissed but had to figure things out themselves.

Long story short, my travel agent got me back home that night but i was jet lagged for several days due to all the screw ups and my store manager wasn't impressed with the other managers that scheduled me and gave me a hard time during my vacation. 

And before anyone asks ""why weren't you charged for the long distance call the first time?"" Singtel (at the time, idk about now, it's  been almost 10 years) had a Tourist Sim program where you could get a SIM card that lasted either  5 or 10 days (your choice) and covered so many minutes of an international call on YOUR end.

But, they had to do it fairly. ROUNDING to the NEAREST quarter-hour.

It was meant to make processing time cards and payroll easier and to reduce clerical mistakes that could potentially actually mess up hours more drastically.

It was done as a time saver, too, obviously. So if an employer processed their own time cards instead of having an HR employee handle the task, and was super cheap, they could take a little extra time to be sure they always rounded up or down in their favor. Yes, then that is absolutely wage theft. The rounding rule has to be applied fairly. 4:01 would become 4:00. 4:10 would become 4:15. 4:25 would become 4:30.

That was in the past. Nowadays, even the smallest employer can save even more money and time by having things more automated. And in that case, no rounding is necessary or beneficial. Computers make it unnecessary.

Remember, the practice was not designed to save money on labor hours - they should come out to be the same with rounding over time. So all it reduced was time to process payroll and errors made doing so.

Any employer that decides to save money by spending more time nowadays to go out of their way to always round in their favor is probably not making a lot of money and is spending their time focused on the small things, not trusting their staff and treating them well, and is generally maybe struggling at their business anyway.

And stealing. That's stealing. It's a fine line. Which is one reason why when computerized systems came along, it was advantageous to abandon the rounding practice -- it caused issues and questions even when it was done honestly and fairly, which could still hurt trust, cohesiveness, and as a result productivity and insider thefts, etc... better to be completely transparent with employees so there are no questions along those lines any more.","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9995279312133789}"

I was the first employee at a start up company, almost 2 years later I was the ""operations manager"", owner of the company went on a vacation out of the country for a week and a half, his son who worked there also hurt himself so he was off work, and we just hired a new lady to work in our office. I was doing my work, his son's work, and training the new lady remotely over the phone since I was in the field. I deduced from the other 4 companies I talked to that I was being underpaid by $2/hr, not to mention I was a ""manager"", so I was doing more work than the people at the other companies as well. Told my boss I wanted a $4 raise. $2 to match the other companies, and another $2 for the time I've been there plus the responsibilities I've taken on.

He said no.

His two reasons were A, the people I've talked to don't actually pay their employees that much/earn that much, and B, I didn't know how to do the new hire's job EVEN THOUGH I TRAINED HER REMOTELY WHILE DOING THE WORK OF TWO PEOPLE

He agreed to the $2 if I took on more responsibility. I thought about it because I wasn't sure if I was being irrational. But eventually that $2 became $1, and a month after that conversation I quit

The store was open 13 hours a day (8-9), 14 during holidays, 7 days a week.  The rule was you had to have two people closing (state required minimum 4 hour shift.)  Trucks were expected to be worked on 2-3 days a week starting at 6 am instead of 8 AM.

Let's do some math.  13x7=91 +1/2 hour per day for open or closing time (counting drawers, etc.) 3.5 hours + second person closing 4x7 = 28 plus the extra 2 hours x 2 days x3 employees to work truck = 12 hours.  Goodness, we are already up to 134.5 hours.  I guess the extra 14.5 hours will have to come out of a salaried employee.  Oh, that's me.  Now, who do I want to work alone for the 9 hours a day we don't have double coverage?  No one?  Ok, I guess that means I'm also working the 9 x7 = 63 hours it takes to have double coverage.  Add in the 14.5, and we have 77.5 hours a week I need to work to make sure there aren't hours at a time with only one employee in the store.

All for the lovely salary of around $35K per year.  And all before the first employee calls off or quits and no one is there to cover them.

Managers at Dollar General either work alone for about 16 hours a week, go over budget, or work every damn day.

He did his best. He gathered up all of the loose garbage, he wiped up all of the spills, he put everything in order that he could. However, at the end of that hour, the enclosure was not up to his manager's standards, and so he received an informal reprimand.

The next day, the enclosure was just as messy as ever, and so his manager decided to teach him a lesson. His manager said pointedly that he was going to clean up the enclosure perfectly, and do so in only 15 minutes, while Mike watched.

Sure enough, due to experience, planning, skill, and intelligence, his manager had this area perfect in less than 15 minutes. End of story.

And so, according to Mike, this taught him there was *always* enough time to get the work done, no matter what it was. I should not be making excuses about insufficient time.

What I wanted to say at this point: Okay, Mike, go ahead and write, test, and debug this code for me *yourself* in the two days you have allotted.

What I actually said: Mike, it sounds like your manager at that fast food restaurant was much more accomplished at his job than any inexperienced teenager could possibly be.

What I was thinking: Mike, you are really horrible at analogies.","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.997218132019043}"

Since a lot of people seem to misunderstand how this works, I'll clarify. The obligation of an employer is to maintain accurate timekeeping for every employee. How they do this isn't regulated, but the information required is. (hours worked per day, clock in/out times, breaks, paid wages, etc.) This means they don't have to use a time clock, but if they do, they must still report accurate hours for the employee with that system.

In the OP's case they have a malfunctioning time clock system. That's an employer problem, not an employee one, but the employer is threatening not to pay employees for hours \*they should know the employee is working.\* If this came up in litigation or a labor dispute at a state/local level, the employer would be on the hook to show that the employee did not work using the \*accurate hours they are required by law to keep.\*

The first response to that requirement would be the (correct) statement that their time clock system is not functioning properly and therefore they are not keeping accurate records. In several states (California/NY/et al) the lack of accurate employer records alone is sufficient basis to rely solely on employee verbal claims for damages, since it is not the employees job to keep  the accurate records. In other states a simple written record kept by the employee with dates/times is sufficient.

Also - you people trying to defend the employer need to knock it off. Their job is to maintain accurate records and they are failing to do so. Getting upset because I don't tolerate nonsense from employers doesn't make me upset it just makes you look like a weirdo.  


Previous:

So this is an interesting scenario where its actually fairly cut and dry how its handled. Employers are responsible for accurately reporting hours, full stop. It doesn't matter if an employee time clock doesn't work, or they forget to report, or what have you. \*Accurately\* reporting that time (and taxes etc) is the sole responsibility of the employer.

They can punish employees for failing to report hours, even fire them, but they cannot simply assume you are not at work when they should reasonably know otherwise. That is fraud, and is a crime. The correct action in scenarios where employee hours are uncertain is to pay tentative or estimated hours as usual for the pay period and verify after the fact. (e.g. if they normally work 40 hours/week, pay them the 40 hours and adjust any difference on the next paycheck)

You can read more about that sort of thing below, but basically, if an employer knows (or should know) about work being done, they must accurately account for and pay for it.

It was a huge concern because the company had started doing the whole ‚Äúno budget for raises. Raises frozen. Sowwwy!‚Äù thing.

So now everyone‚Äôs still having to prep for reviews and fill in evaluations‚Ä¶.for no raises or peanut raises of like 1-2%. Not even match of CoL.

So eventually this team lead got frustrated and fed up enough, he quietly found a better job BUT, on his way out he literally left his laptop plugged in, logged in, and left a sensitive spreadsheet open with his whole team‚Äôs salary information and salary information of other folks. His way of giving the company the middle finger on his way out. 

This started a whirlwind wild fire of resignations as news of salary inequality, shady business practices regarding raises for certain ‚Äúgod ole boys‚Äù and inner circle people but not others spread quickly through the ranks, and the guy‚Äôs entire team resigned all within two weeks.

Why couldn‚Äôt he sell to the workers and aid in the creation of a co-operative?

‚Äúmore than 70 of SecureIT‚Äôs 80 employees ‚Äúon paper, were millionaires,‚Äù .. and then: Between the time of the acquisition [1998] and February 2000, VeriSign‚Äôs stock increased by more than 2,300%, closing at a high of $253 per share, helped by two stock splits and a temporary bubble for tech stocks. The bubble burst later that year, and VeriSign‚Äôs stock lost roughly 75% off that high point at the end of 2000, sinking to a low of nearly $4 in 2002.

So he sold, gave bonuses in the form of company stock, the stock crashed, and the workers were again left with no actual capital. The stock value returned later - but only if the workers held onto their stocks and weren‚Äôt forced to sell in the 20+ years in between the acquisition and the current, slightly lower value. 

The workers weren‚Äôt ever actually made millionaires. Only ‚Äòon paper‚Äô and their ability to become millionaires is questionable. If he had sold to the employees, their ability to have become wealthy would have been much higher, as their income would have been direct and not based on speculation. The claim they were ‚Äúmade millionaires‚Äù is entirely based on a market speculation for a specific time frame, and not over the life of the company afterwards. 

This is a thinly veiled whitewashing which represents corporate ownership as a net positive for employees, and doesn‚Äôt necessarily reflect the actual effects on their earnings or their lives. 



He did a good thing, it could have been much better. He is claiming it was an impressively great thing, but that is not a known fact. None of the employees are quoted directly, only through his memory of the experience from 20+ years ago.","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.999504804611206}"

They were simply convinced that it was their role in life. There was an almost Huxleyan control over how they perceived themselves and their social class.

The great success of the elite is not to disguise their wealth or sell mythology to the public (although they do both of these effectively as well). It is to convince people to be acquiescent with the status quo, and to effectively gatekeep the upper echelons of the class and socio-economic structure.

Huxley described this as ""a method of control by which a people can be made to enjoy a state of affairs by which any decent standard they ought not to enjoy...the enjoyment of servitude"". In *Brave New World*, it is depicted that the population not merely accepts, but expects to be part of the social class to which they've been assigned. They are even somewhat hostile to the idea of climbing the ranks, while also looking down on those below them to a certain extent. 

I have found this to be a consistently accurate representation of how society actually operates, and it was especially prevalent in the attitudes of adults when I was growing up. As a reflection of this, all of the values that I were taught were about accepting your place, responsibilities, and duties.

This may be somewhat different in the US or other countries, but I doubt that it is. However, I can say that the class system is highly ingrained in the UK, so it may be particularly entrenched in our society.","{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9974895715713501}"
